Signal transduction in podocytes--spotlight on receptor tyrosine kinases .
The mammalian kidney filtration barrier is a complex multicellular , multicomponent structure that maintains homeostasis by regulating electrolytes , acid-base balance , and blood pressure ( via maintenance of salt and water balance ) .
To perform these multiple functions , podocytes--an important component of the filtration apparatus--must process a series of intercellular signals .
Integrating these signals with diverse cellular responses enables a coordinated response to various conditions .
Although mature podocytes are terminally differentiated and cannot proliferate , they are able to respond to growth factors .
It is possible that the initial response of podocytes to growth factors is beneficial and protective , and might include the induction of hypertrophic cell growth .
However , extended and/or uncontrolled growth factor signalling might be maladaptive and could result in the induction of apoptosis and podocyte loss .
Growth factors signal via the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) on their target cells and around a quarter of the 58 RTK family members that are encoded in the human genome have been identified in podocytes .
Pharmacological inhibitors of many RTKs exist and are currently used in experimental and clinical cancer therapy .
The identification of pathological RTK mediated signal transduction pathways in podocytes could provide a starting point for the development of novel therapies for glomerular disorders .
