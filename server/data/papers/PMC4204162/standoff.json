Various factors including reactive oxygen species, cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix proteins are reported to be involved in the development of pancreatic cancer. However, the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer has not been completely elucidated. Oxidative stress has been shown to contribute to the development of pancreatic cancer. Evidences supporting the role of reactive oxygen species and cytokines as a risk for pancreatic cancer and the concept of antioxidant supplementation as a preventive approach for pancreatic cancer have been proposed. Here, we review the literature on oxidative stress, cytokine expression, inflammatory signaling, and natural antioxidant supplementation in relation to pancreatic cancer.\n\n\n\n",
