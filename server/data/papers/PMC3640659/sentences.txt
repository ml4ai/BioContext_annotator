Inhibition of Pref-1 ( Preadipocyte Factor 1 ) by Estradiol in Adolescent Girls with Anorexia Nervosa is Associated with Improvement in Lumbar Bone Mineral Density .
Objective .
Adolescents with anorexia nervosa ( AN ) are amenorrheic and have decreased bone mass accrual and low bone mineral density ( BMD ) .
The regulation of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation is an important factor governing bone formation .
Preadipocyte factor 1 ( Pref-1 ) , an inhibitor of adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation , is elevated in states of estrogen deficiency .
In this study , we aim to ( i ) investigate effects of transdermal estradiol on Pref-1 in adolescent girls with AN , and ( ii ) examine associations of changes in Pref-1 with changes in lumbar BMD and bone turnover markers .
Design .
Adolescent girls with AN and normal-weight controls were studied cross-sectionally .
Girls with AN were examined longitudinally in a double-blind study and received transdermal estradiol ( plus cyclic medroxyprogesterone ) or placebo for twelve months .
Patients .
69 girls ( 44 with AN , 25 normal-weight controls ) 13-18 years were studied at baseline ; 22 AN girls were followed prospectively .
Measurements .
Pref-1 levels , bone formation and resorption markers , and BMD .
Results .
Pref-1 levels decreased in girls with AN after treatment with transdermal estradiol compared with placebo ( -0.015 +/-0.016 vs. 0.060 +/-0.026 ng/ml , p = 0.01 ) , although at baseline , levels did not differ in AN versus controls ( 0.246 +/-0.015 vs. 0.267 +/-0.022 ng/ml ) .
Changes in Pref-1 over twelve months correlated inversely with changes in lumbar BMD ( r = -0.48 , p = 0.02 ) and positively with changes in CTX ( r = 0.73 , p = 0.006 ) .
Conclusions .
For the first time , we show that Pref-1 is negatively regulated by estradiol in adolescent girls with AN .
Inhibition of Pref-1 may mediate the beneficial effects of transdermal estradiol replacement on BMD in girls with AN .
