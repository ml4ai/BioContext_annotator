The Role of Delta like 1 Shedding in Muscle Cell Self-Renewal and Differentiation .
Summary .
Myogenic cells have the ability to adopt two divergent fates upon exit from the cell cycle : differentiation or self-renewal .
The Notch signaling pathway is a well-known negative regulator of myogenic differentiation .
Using mouse primary myoblasts cultured in vitro or C2C12 myogenic cells , we find that Notch activity is essential for maintaining the expression of Pax7 , a transcription factor associated with the self-renewal lineage , in quiescent undifferentiated myoblasts after they exit the cell cycle .
Stimulation of the Notch pathway by expression of a constitutively active Notch 1 or co-culture of myogenic cells with Delta like-1 ( Dll1 )-transfected CHO cells increases the level of Pax7 .
Dll1 , a ligand for Notch receptor , is shed by ADAM metalloproteases in a pool of Pax7 positive C2C12 reserve cells , but it remains intact in differentiated myotubes .
Dll1 shedding changes the receptor and ligand ratio and modulates the level of Notch signaling .
Inhibition of Dll1 cleavage by a soluble , dominant negative mutant form of ADAM12 leads to elevation of Notch signaling , inhibition of differentiation , and expansion of the pool of self renewing Pax7-positive and MyoD-negative cells .
These results suggest that ADAM mediated shedding of Dll1 in a subset of cells during myogenic differentiation in vitro contributes to down-regulation of Notch signaling in neighboring cells and facilitates their progression into differentiation .
We propose that the proteolytic processing of Dll1 helps achieve an asymmetry in Notch signaling in initially equivalent myogenic cells and helps sustain the balance between differentiation and self-renewal .
