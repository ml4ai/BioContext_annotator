Neurotensin Decreases the Proinflammatory Status of Human Skin Fibroblasts and Increases Epidermal Growth Factor Expression .
Fibroblasts colonization into injured areas during wound healing ( WH ) is responsible for skin remodelling and is also involved in the modulation of inflammation , as fibroblasts are immunologically active .
Herein , we aimed to determine neurotensin effect on the immunomodulatory profile of fibroblasts , both in homeostatic and inflammatory conditions .
Neurotensin mediated responses occurred through NTR1 or NTR3 receptors , while under inflammatory conditions NTR1 expression increase seemed to modulate neurotensin responses .
Among different immunomodulatory genes , CCL11 , IL-8 , and IL-6 were the most expressed genes , while CCL4 and EGF were the less expressed genes .
After neurotensin exposure , IL-8 mRNA expression was increased while CCL11 was decreased , suggesting a proinflammatory upregulation and chemoattractant ability downregulation of fibroblasts .
Under inflammatory conditions , gene expression was significantly increased .
After neurotensin exposure , CCL4 and IL-6 mRNA expression were decreased while CCL11 was increased , suggesting again a decrease in the chemoattractant capacity of fibroblasts and in their proinflammatory status .
Furthermore , the expression of EGF , a crucial growth factor for skin cells proliferation and WH , was increased in all conditions .
Overall , neurotensin , released by nerve fibers or skin cells , may be involved in the decrease of the chemotaxis and the proinflammatory status in the proliferation and remodelling phases of WH .

Introduction .
Neuropeptides can be produced by skin cells or be released by peripheral nerves into the skin , where they bind to respective receptors stimulating different signalling pathways and cellular responses [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Within the cellular responses and events that can be modulated in the skin by neuropeptides , inflammatory processes are some of the most important .
However , the role of neurotensin ( NT ) in the modulation of skin inflammation is still unclear .
The first report demonstrating NT positive fibbers in the skin was in 1983 [ XREF_BIBR ] and it was later confirmed by Donelan et al. in 2006 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The interest in NT first appeared when its influence on the pathogenesis of skin disorders exacerbated by stress was discovered [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In fact , it has been observed that in many skin disorders worsened by stress , the number and activation status of mast cells increase .
Accordingly , NT has been shown to increase the number and activation of mast cells in a skin pathogenesis , such as psoriasis [ XREF_BIBR ] , which is in agreement with several other reports showing that mast cell degranulation is triggered by stress and via neurotensin [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Moreover , skin vascular permeability induced by corticotropin releasing hormone ( CRH ) on mast cells has been shown to occur through a neurotensin dependent mechanism [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In fact , human mast cells are able to synthesize a neurotensin precursor , secrete bioactive NT like peptide ( s ) , and express NT receptor NTS1 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Besides mast cells , neurotensin has also been shown to enhance the chemotaxis capacity of lymphocytes and to limit the growth of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tumor cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Most recently , we have demonstrated that NT can modulate inflammatory events on a skin dendritic cell line [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Fetal-skin dendritic cells expressed both NTR1 and NTR3 and neurotensin was able to downregulate the activation of inflammatory signalling pathways and the expression of cytokines IL-6 , TNF-alpha , and IL-10 , as well as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , while upregulating the survival pathway ERK and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) expression [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In spite of these results not much has been studied regarding NT effects in fibroblasts .
Therefore , in the present study we used a cell line established from the skin of normal newborn human foreskin fibroblasts .
Fibroblasts are a heterogeneous population of cells of mesenchymal origin which support the development , repair , and homeostasis of their resident tissue .
Dermal fibroblasts play a key role in extracellular matrix ( ECM ) deposition , epithelial-mesenchymal interactions , and wound healing [ XREF_BIBR ] .
They also contribute to the immune regulation of the skin , producing and releasing chemokines IL-8 and CCL5 , cyclooxygenases , and prostanoids , after activation by inflammatory agents , such as bacterial agents [ XREF_BIBR ] .
By using this cell line , we intended to decrease the variability of the donors , although lacking the variability of skin from different body locations .
Using fibroblasts from the foreskin ensures the use of cells from a skin area replenished of a rich and complex network of nerves with neurophysiologic parameters [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
The main aim of this work was to unravel the effect of neurotensin and its chemoattractant capacity in newborn foreskin fibroblasts , in both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions , in order to understand the possible physiological role of this neuropeptide in skin wound healing as well as speculate about the role of this neuropeptide in other skin pathologies .

Results .
3.1 .
Expression of Neurotensin and Its Receptors on Skin Fibroblasts .
BJ cells do not constitutively express neurotensin , under either basal conditions or LPS stimulation ( data not shown ) .
The expression of neurotensin receptors , namely , NTR1 , NTR2 , and NTR3 , was determined by real-time RT-PCR , Western blot , and immunocytochemistry analyses .
BJ cells constitutively express the genes for NTR1 , NTR2 , and NTR3 , with NTR2 being the most abundant , as shown in XREF_FIG .
However , only the NTR1 and NTR3 were effectively transduced to protein , as observed in XREF_FIG , indicating possible cellular posttranscription modification .
Brain homogenates from the cortical cortex of mice were used as positive controls for NTR reactivity , since they express all neurotensin receptors , as determined by Western blot analysis ( XREF_FIG ) .
In addition , the expression of neurotensin receptors was studied under inflammatory conditions .
The stimulation of BJ cells with LPS for 6 h caused an increase in NTR1 and NTR2 gene expression of 2.9 +/- 1.9- ( * P < 0.05 , n = 3 ) and 0.7 +/- 0.9- ( n = 3 ) fold above control , respectively .
However , the expression of NTR3 slightly diminished by 0.2 +/- 0.3- ( n = 3 ) fold , as shown in XREF_FIG .
Neurotensin receptor localization was measured in these cells and it was verified that NTR1 is localized at the cell membrane , in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus , while NTR3 is mainly found in the nucleus ( XREF_FIG ) .
3.2 .
Modulation of Gene Expression in Fibroblasts by LPS .
To evaluate the expression of different genes under homeostatic conditions and upon 6 h of LPS exposure , real-time RT-PCR was performed for CCL4 , CCL5 , CCL11 , IL-8 , IL-1beta , IL-6 , and epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) .
Nonstimulated BJ cells constitutively expressed all chemokines , cytokines , and the growth factor EGF , with IL-6 , IL-8 , and CCL11 being the most expressed genes , by 1.6 x 10 4 +/- 1.1 x 10 4 ( # # < 0.01 , n = 4 ) , 2.8 x 10 4 +/- 1.9 x 10 4 ( # # # < 0.001 , n = 4 ) , and 2.5 x 10 4 +/- 1.7 x 10 4 ( # # # < 0.01 , n = 4 ) , respectively , relative to HPRT1 gene expression , while CCL4 was barely expressed , by 6.4 +/- 5.0 ( n = 4 ) , relative to HPRT1 gene expression ( XREF_FIG ) .
When stimulated with LPS , the expression levels of all these genes were highly upregulated , including the expression of chemokine CCL5 ( * P < 0.05 ) , IL-1beta ( * P < 0.05 , n = 4 ) , CCL4 ( * * P < 0.01 , n = 4 ) , CCL11 ( * * P < 0.01 , n = 4 ) , IL-8 ( * * P < 0.01 , n = 4 ) , and IL-6 ( * * P < 0.01 , n = 4 ) , relative to nonstimulated cells ( XREF_FIG ) , reinforcing the role of fibroblasts as skin immunomodulators .
3.3 .
Modulation of Gene Expression in Fibroblast by Neurotensin .
To evaluate the effect of neurotensin on key inflammatory cytokines and chemokines , BJ cells were incubated with the neuropeptide alone , or with the inflammatory stimulus of LPS alone , or were incubated with the combination of both neurotensin and LPS ( XREF_FIG ) .
Indeed , cells were treated with ( 1 ) either 10 or 100 nM of NT for 30 h ; ( 2 ) incubated with LPS alone for 6 h ; ( 3 ) incubated with either 10 or 100 nM of NT for 24 h before an additional stimulus of LPS for 6 h ; or ( 4 ) left untreated ( control ) .
To understand the role of neurotensin in the skin , specifically in skin fibroblasts , cells were subjected to different neurotensin concentrations ( 10 and 100 nM ) in and out of an inflammatory environment ( LPS stimulus ) .
In fact , to better comprehend the role of neurotensin in an inflammatory environment , cells were firstly pretreated with NT and subsequently stimulated with LPS .
Furthermore , this protocol may simulate an in vivo NT treatment immediately after an injury ( before inflammation starts ) .
After these incubation periods , total RNA was isolated , quantified , and reverse transcribed to cDNA to finally perform real-time RT-PCR .
BJ cells treated with NT ( 10 nM ) significantly increased the expression of EGF and IL-8 by 1.07 +/- 0.45- ( * P < 0.05 , n = 3 ) and 0.88 +/- 0.48- ( * P < 0.01 , n = 3 ) fold above control , respectively , while decreased CCL4 expression by -0.59 +/- 0.27- ( * P < 0.01 , n = 3 ) fold below the control ( XREF_FIG ) .
However , neither the cytokine nor the chemokine profile of these cells showed significant differences in expression when cells were incubated with 100 nM of NT ( XREF_FIG ) .
However , when cells were pretreated with NT ( 10 nM ) during 24 h followed by a 6 h LPS stimulus , both the cytokine and chemokine profiles of these cells were significantly modulated .
When cells were stimulated with both 10 nM of NT and LPS , the expression of CCL4 was significantly decreased by 0.59 +/- 0.28- ( * P < 0.05 , n = 3 ) fold , relative to the control , as shown in XREF_FIG .
In addition , when cells were incubated with 100 nM of NT plus LPS , the expression of cytokines IL-6 was significantly reduced by 1.09 +/- 0.87 ( * P < 0.05 , n = 4 ) , relative to cells treated with NT ( 10 nM ) .
In contrast , the chemokine CCL11 showed a significant increase in expression of 0.65 +/- 0.43- ( * P < 0.05 , n = 3 ) fold relative to cells treated with NT ( 10 nM ) .
Furthermore , EGF expression was significantly increased by 0.99 +/- 0.785- ( * P < 0.05 , n = 3 ) fold relative to the control ( XREF_FIG ) .
In conclusion , we observed that , in the presence of neurotensin ( 10 nM ) , BJ cells presented a decrease in CCL11 chemokine expression and an increase in IL-8 cytokine expression .
Under inflammatory conditions and in the presence of neurotensin , BJ cells presented a decrease in CCL4 and IL-6 , while an increase in CCL-11 expression .
Furthermore EGF expression was increased in cells incubated with NT either alone or in combination with LPS .
4 .
Discussion .
BJ cells expressed the NTR1 and NTR3 ; NTR1 was located at the cell membrane , cytoplasm , and nucleus while NTR3 was exclusively located in the nucleus .
As NTR3 is exclusively localized in the nucleus , its mediated responses can only occur by intracellular neurotensin .
Regarding that neurotensin is not expressed by BJ cells , as they do not express NT , NT-NTR3 signalling pathway can only be activated by endocytosed neurotensin previously produced by neighbouring skin cells , such as keratinocytes .
Furthermore , NT-NTR3 mediated response will have a later effect in comparison to NT-NTR1 mediated response because NTR1 is located at the cell membrane and the activation of this signalling pathway does not require NT internalization .
Furthermore , upon NT binding to its receptors , NT activates different signalling pathways and cell responses , such as chemokine and cytokine expression , as previously described by us for a dendritic cell line and by others [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Neuropeptides receptor expression under an inflammatory environment has been shown to be regulated by neuropeptides , as observed in rat macrophages for substance P receptors [ XREF_BIBR ] and in HUVECs for NPY receptors [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Indeed , we determined if the expression of neurotensin receptors differed in an inflammatory environment and , after cell exposure to LPS , the gene expression of NTR1 was induced while the expression of NTR3 decreased .
These results suggest that the upregulation of neurotensin receptors in an inflammatory environment ( LPS ) will lead to a rise on NT mediated effects and propagation of NT signalling pathways .
Although endogenous NT was not expressed in BJ cells , exogenous NT produced by neighbouring cells can play an important role in NTR activation .
Regarding NT effects on the immunomodulatory function of BJ cells , NT downregulated the immunomodulatory ability of BJ cells under inflammatory conditions and significantly upregulated EGF expression , a crucial growth factor involved in cell growth and wound healing [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Under homeostatic conditions , exogenous NT was able to significantly upregulate IL-8 and downregulate CCL11 in these cells .
These cytokines are involved in the important process of immune cell recruitment to the site of inflammation [ XREF_BIBR ] .
IL-8 is a neutrophil activating cytokine which induces chemotaxis and the release of granule enzymes [ XREF_BIBR ] while CCL11 ( or eotaxin ) is an important eosinophil chemoattractant which also recruits basophils , Th2 lymphocytes , and tryptase-chymase mast cells [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Since fibroblasts orchestrate and respond to inflammatory cascades , NT upregulation of IL-8 could activate neutrophils while downregulation of CCL11 chemokine expression could decrease leukocyte recruitment in homeostatic conditions .
Under an inflammatory environment ( LPS treatment ) , NT seemed to have the opposite effect in respect to chemokine and cytokine profile , significantly downregulating the chemoattractant CCL4 and proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 .
Meanwhile , NT also upregulated CCL11 .
Besides being a chemoattractant , CCL11 may also induce eosinophil degranulation [ XREF_BIBR ] and IgE independent degranulation of basophils [ XREF_BIBR ] , promoting adaptive immune responses , through the selective recruitment of Th2 lymphocytes , which is dependent on the expression of CCR4 and CCR8 on Th2 cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Indeed , the increased expression of CCL11 mediated by NT in fibroblasts could be involved in a Th2 polarized response .
Considering epidermal growth factor , a cell growth and wound healing growth factor , its expression was significantly enhanced , which is in accordance with our previous study performed in dendritic cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In fact , this same effect was already observed in granulation fibroblasts by the neuropeptide substance P [ XREF_BIBR ] .
EGF increase may potentially be triggering autocrine effects on BJ cells as well as paracrine effects on keratinocytes , by modulating epidermal proliferation and differentiation [ XREF_BIBR ] , also emphasising the importance of the EGF effect in the wound closure of wound healing [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
5 .
Conclusion .
These results report the effect of exogenous NT under both homeostatic ( without LPS ) and inflammatory conditions ( with LPS ) in BJ cells .
Under inflammatory conditions , NT was able to downregulate the chemoattractant function of fibroblasts , vital for the last phases of wound healing , which include its migration proliferation and remodelling phases .
Downregulation of chemokines triggered by exogenous NT could decrease the inflammatory status of the wound and could beneficially promote migration of fibroblasts to the wound site , with consequent expression of ECM proteins , important for skin repair .
Furthermore , EGF mediated effects on fibroblasts and keratinocytes will be fulcra for the remodelling phase of wound healing .
Indeed , delayed wounds like diabetic wound healing , characterized by a proinflammatory cytokine profile [ XREF_BIBR ] , could potentially be treated with NT , promoting the transition of the inflammatory phase to the last phases of wound healing , thus improving wound healing .
Overall our results suggest that neurotensin may be of great value in therapeutic approaches for inflammatory skin diseases , through promoting wound healing .
However , our in vitro model has limitations and treatment of fibroblasts in vitro with NT may not mimic its biological processes in their native environment , not taking into account the neuroendocrine , for example , sympathetic and parasympathetic , control of tissues .
Thus , these findings should be confirmed with in vivo experiments .
Meanwhile , we can hypothesize that in vivo NT administration , under similar conditions , may promote a decreased inflammatory response through these cells , which may be important in the later phases of healing .
In vivo studies are needed to further confirm the potential application of NT as a therapy for diabetic foot ulcers .
