The influence of tethered epidermal growth factor on connective tissue progenitor colony formation .
Strategies to combine aspirated marrow cells with scaffolds to treat connective tissue defects are gaining increasing clinical attention and use .
In situations such as large defects where initial survival and proliferation of transplanted connective tissue progenitors ( CTPs ) is limiting , therapeutic outcomes might be improved by using the scaffold to deliver growth factors that promote the early stages of cell function in the graft .
Signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) plays a role in cell survival and has been implicated in bone development and homeostasis .
Providing epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) in a scaffold tethered format may sustain local delivery and shift EGFR signaling to pro survival modes compared to soluble ligand .
We therefore examined the effect of tethered EGF on osteogenic colony formation from human bone marrow aspirates in the context of three different adhesion environments using a total of 39 donors .
We found that tethered EGF , but not soluble EGF , increased the numbers of colonies formed regardless of adhesion background , and that tethered EGF did not impair early stages of osteogenic differentiation .
