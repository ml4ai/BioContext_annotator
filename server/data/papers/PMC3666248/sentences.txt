Effects of Epidermal Growth Factor and Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor on the Proliferation and Osteogenic and Neural Differentiation of Adipose Derived Stem Cells .
Abstract .
Stem cells used for clinical tissue regeneration therapy should have the capacity of self-renewal , high proliferation , and differentiation and be able to be transplanted in large numbers .
Although high concentrations of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) may induce the differentiation of stem cells , these factors have been widely used to enhance the propagation of stem cells , including adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells ( ASCs ) .
However , the effects of low concentrations of EGF and bFGF on stem cells need to be evaluated carefully .
This study illustrates that low concentrations of EGF ( 5 ng/mL ) and bFGF ( 10 ng/mL ) increase the proliferative ability of ASCs and induce the typical spindle shaped cell morphology .
EGF and bFGF added to medium promoted neural lineage differentiation and impaired the mesodermal differentiation ability of ASCs .
This study demonstrates that even low concentrations of EGF and bFGF may limit the differentiation ability of stem cells during stem cell expansion in vitro .
EGF and bFGF supplementation should be carefully considered in stem cells for clinical applications .
