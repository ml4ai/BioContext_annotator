      "text":"\n\nThe insulin/IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1)-activated protein kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) phosphorylates Ser 487  in the \u2018ST loop\u2019 (serine/threonine-rich loop) within the C-terminal domain of AMPK-α1 (AMP-activated protein kinase-α1), leading to inhibition of phosphorylation by upstream kinases at the activating site, Thr 172 . Surprisingly, the equivalent site on AMPK-α2, Ser 491 , is not an Akt target and is modified instead by autophosphorylation. Stimulation of HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells with IGF-1 caused reduced subsequent Thr 172  phosphorylation and activation of AMPK-α1 in response to the activator A769662 and the Ca 2+  ionophore A23187, effects we show to be dependent on Akt activation and Ser 487  phosphorylation. Consistent with this, in three PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10)-null tumour cell lines (in which the lipid phosphatase PTEN that normally restrains the Akt pathway is absent and Akt is thus hyperactivated), AMPK was resistant to activation by A769662. However, full AMPK activation could be restored by pharmacological inhibition of Akt, or by re-expression of active PTEN. We also show that inhibition of Thr 172  phosphorylation is due to interaction of the phosphorylated ST loop with basic side chains within the αC-helix of the kinase domain. Our findings reveal that a previously unrecognized effect of hyperactivation of Akt in tumour cells is to restrain activation of the LKB1 (liver kinase B1)\u2013AMPK pathway, which would otherwise inhibit cell growth and proliferation.\n\n\n\n",

        "text":"AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a ubiquitously expressed sensor of cellular energy status [XREF_BIBR], which exists in essentially all eukaryotic cells as heterotrimeric complexes comprising a catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits. The α subunits are phosphorylated by upstream kinases at conserved threonine residues within the activation loop (Thr 172  in rat α1/α2), causing >100-fold activation [XREF_BIBR]. Kinases that phosphorylate Thr 172  include the tumour suppressor LKB1 (liver kinase B1) [XREF_BIBR\u2013XREF_BIBR], and the Ca 2+ -dependent kinase CaMKKβ (calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase β) [XREF_BIBR\u2013XREF_BIBR]. The γ subunits contain up to three sites where ADP or AMP bind in competition with ATP [XREF_BIBR\u2013XREF_BIBR]. Binding of AMP or ADP causes conformational changes that enhance net phosphorylation at Thr 172  by inhibiting dephosphorylation, whereas binding of AMP, but not ADP, promotes phosphorylation by LKB1 and causes allosteric activation [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR\u2013XREF_BIBR]. The drug A769662 and the natural product salicylate mimic the ability of AMP to inhibit Thr 172  dephosphorylation and cause allosteric activation, but bind at a different site involving the β subunit [XREF_BIBR\u2013XREF_BIBR].\n\n",

Such stresses include compounds inhibiting mitochondrial ATP synthesis, such as the anti-diabetic drugs metformin and phenformin, and the natural products galegine, resveratrol and berberine [XREF_BIBR]. Once activated, AMPK switches on catabolic pathways that generate ATP while switching off anabolic pathways and other ATP-requiring processes such as progress through the cell cycle [XREF_BIBR]. Thus AMPK has a cytostatic effect on proliferating cells, suggesting that it might exert some of the tumour suppressor effects of its upstream kinase, LKB1. This was supported by recent studies of a mouse B-cell lymphoma model, in which AMPK appeared to act as a negative regulator both of the rapid glycolysis (Warburg effect) and the high growth rate of the tumours [XREF_BIBR].\n\n",

        "text":"If the LKB1\u2013AMPK pathway acts as a tumour suppressor, one might expect many tumour cells to have been selected for mechanisms that down-regulate it. Indeed, somatic loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding LKB1 (STK11) occur in approximately 30% of non-small-cell lung cancers [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR] and 20% of cervical cancers [XREF_BIBR]. In the HeLa cell, derived from a cervical cancer that had undergone a large deletion in STK11 [XREF_BIBR], increases in AMP and ADP do not enhance Thr 172  phosphorylation [XREF_BIBR] because the basal activity of CaMKKβ is too low to support this unless intracellular Ca 2+  is also elevated [XREF_BIBR]. Somatic mutations in genes encoding AMPK appear to be less frequent in tumours than those in STK11, perhaps due to redundancy between multiple AMPK isoforms. However, there may be epigenetic or non-genetic mechanisms by which AMPK is down-regulated in tumour cells. For example, AMPK-α2 expression appears to be frequently down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma [XREF_BIBR].\n\n",

Interestingly, Akt phosphorylates the α1 subunit of rat AMPK at Ser 485  (equivalent to Ser 487  in human α1), and this was reported to reduce subsequent Thr 172  phosphorylation and activation by LKB1 [XREF_BIBR]. Additionally, PKA (protein kinase A; also known as cAMP-dependent protein kinase) was reported to phosphorylate Ser 485  with similar effects [XREF_BIBR]. High glucose and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) also caused phosphorylation of AMPK-α1 at Ser 487  in porcine vascular smooth muscle cells, and this was associated with reduced Thr 172  phosphorylation in response to metformin [XREF_BIBR]. This mechanism has also been invoked to account for down-regulation of AMPK in human hepatoma cells infected with hepatitis C virus [XREF_BIBR]. However, these studies did not provide definitive proof that the Ser 485 /Ser 487  phosphorylation and the reduced Thr 172  phosphorylation observed in the intact cells were causally related.\n\n",

This loop was disordered in the crystal structure of a partial mammalian αβγ complex expressed in bacteria [XREF_BIBR]. We now refer to it as the \u2018ST loop\u2019 because it is rich in serine and threonine residues, and it has recently been shown to be phosphorylated by GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) at Thr 481  and Ser 477  (human numbering), which appeared to promote Thr 172  dephosphorylation [XREF_BIBR]. In the present study, we have examined whether phosphorylation of this loop causes down-regulation of AMPK in tumour cells in which the Akt pathway is hyperactivated. We also provide evidence that the ST loop binds to the kinase domain when phosphorylated at Ser 487  by interactions with the αC helix, thus physically blocking access to Thr 172 .\n\n",

For comparison, we used an inactive (D200A) mutant of the known Akt substrate GSK3β, with or without mutation of the Akt site (Ser 9 ). Interestingly, AMPK-α1 was a reasonable substrate for Akt although not as good as GSK3, whereas AMPK-α2 was a very poor substrate. Using either an anti-pS9 antibody or by  32 P-labelling, phosphorylation of GSK3β was saturated at 0.5 unit/ml Akt, when the phosphorylation stoichiometry by  32 P-labelling was 1.03 mol/mol (XREF_FIGB). The phosphorylation of AMPK-α1 within the α1β2γ1 complex was only saturated at 5 units/ml, when the stoichiometry was 0.96 mol/mol (XREF_FIGC). For both GSK3β and AMPK-α1, the signals obtained using phospho-specific antibodies (pS9/pS487) or  32 P-labelling were abolished by mutation of the respective sites to alanine (S9A/S487A). By contrast, there was much less phosphorylation of Ser 491  within the α2β2γ1 complex (XREF_FIGD). By  32 P-labelling, the stoichiometry of α2 phosphorylation was only 0.18 mol/mol, even with Akt at 30- and 300-fold higher concentrations than those required to obtain stoichiometric phosphorylation of α1 and GSK3β respectively. Although we did detect some phosphorylation of Ser 491  using a phospho-specific antibody and this was abolished in a S491A mutant,  32 P-labelling was not affected by the S491A mutation, suggesting that the low level of α2 phosphorylation by Akt was mainly accounted for by modification at other site(s).\n\n",

        "text":"It has been reported previously that prior phosphorylation of Ser 485  on rat AMPK-α1 by Akt, within a rat α1β1γ1 complex, caused a 40% reduction in the rate of subsequent phosphorylation of Thr 172  and activation by LKB1 in cell-free assays, an effect that was abolished by a non-phosphorylatable S485A substitution [XREF_BIBR]. In the present study, we have followed up this observation and made several new findings. First, we demonstrated identical effects with the equivalent site (Ser 487 ) on the human α1β2γ1 complex (XREF_FIGF and XREF_FIG), showing that the effect is conserved in humans and is also independent of the β subunit isoform. Secondly, we show that the effect is not specific to the upstream kinase LKB1, but is also observed with CaMKKβ (XREF_FIGC). Thirdly, we report that Ser 491  (the site equivalent to Ser 487  in AMPK-α2) is an extremely poor substrate for Akt, and that the very low level of α2 phosphorylation obtained using Akt is not affected by an S491A mutation (XREF_FIGD). It had been shown previously using a bacterially expressed α2β1γ1 complex that Akt phosphorylated AMPK-α2, albeit more slowly than α1 [XREF_BIBR] and, although the phosphorylation site(s) had not been identified, it has generally been assumed that this phosphorylation occurred at Ser 491 . That Ser 491  is modified instead by autophosphorylation is shown by the following findings: (i) substantial phosphorylation of Ser 491  occurred with the recombinant human α2β2γ1 complex in the absence of exogenous kinases (XREF_FIGA and XREF_FIGB); (ii) Ser 491  phosphorylation did not occur with an inactive (D157A mutant) complex (XREF_FIGB); (iii) various forms of AMPK, including the human α2β2γ1 complex, phosphorylated a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence around Ser 491 , but not Ser 485  on rat α1 (XREF_FIGD); and (iv) Ser 491  on AMPK-α2 became phosphorylated in response to the AMPK activator berberine in HEK-293 cells, whereas Ser 487  on AMPK-α1 did not (XREF_FIGC). Although further work is required to test whether autophosphorylation of Ser 491  down-regulates Thr 172  phosphorylation, this is not supported by the results in XREF_FIG(C), where the activation of the human α2β2γ1 complex by LKB1 was not affected by a potentially phosphomimetic S491D mutation. Thus the ability of Akt-activating treatments such as insulin and IGF-1 to restrain activation of AMPK by ST loop phosphorylation is limited to complexes containing the α1 isoform.\n\n",

        "text":"Although Ser 487  in the human α1β2γ1 complex also appeared to autophosphorylate to a limited extent in cell-free assays (XREF_FIGA), increased Ser 487  phosphorylation did not occur when intact cells were incubated with the AMPK activator berberine (XREF_FIGC), suggesting that autophosphorylation of Ser 487  is not significant in intact cells. Interestingly, the small degree of Ser 487  autophosphorylation in cell-free assays did not increase when the α1β2γ1 complex was activated by phosphorylation at Thr 172  by LKB1 (XREF_FIGB, top left), suggesting that Thr 172  phosphorylation (unlike its effects on phosphorylation of exogenous substrates) does not enhance Ser 487  autophosphorylation. Our results show that Ser 487  in human α1, unlike Ser 491  in α2, is a good substrate for Akt. Although only phosphorylated in cell-free assays at approximately 10% of the rate of Ser 9  on GSK3-β (a canonical Akt site), in the intact cells the net phosphorylation status would also be affected by the activity of protein phosphatases acting on Ser 487 . The results using MK2206 in XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG clearly confirm that Ser 487  is phosphorylated in four distinct cell lines in an Akt-dependent manner.\n\n",

Although a 40% effect might appear to be quite modest, the effect appears to be larger in intact cells (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG), where the activities of phosphatases acting on Ser 487  would affect the outcome. Another explanation for the different size of the effect in cell-free assays and intact cells is that other sites in the ST loop may be phosphorylated in the intact cells, a possibility discussed further below.\n\n",

It has been reported recently that Ser 491  on AMPK-α2 can be phosphorylated by S6K1 [XREF_BIBR], so we considered the possibility that Ser 487  might have been phosphorylated by a kinase downstream of Akt and mTORC1, such as S6K1, rather than directly by Akt.

        "text":"To place our studies in the context of tumour cells, we also addressed whether AMPK activation was down-regulated in three PTEN-null tumour cell lines derived from human cancers. Interestingly, in two glioblastoma cell lines and a breast cancer cell line in which Akt was hyperactivated due to loss of PTEN, AMPK was rather resistant to activation and Thr 172  phosphorylation induced by the activator A769662. However, this effect was reversed by the addition of MK2206, a selective inhibitor of Akt activation that also reduced or abolished the phosphorylation of AMPK-α1 on Ser 487 , of GSK3β on Ser 9  and of Akt itself on Thr 308  and Ser 473 . These effects could also be reversed in DBTRG-05MG cells by re-expressing WT PTEN, but not a phosphatase-inactive (C124S) mutant. Our results suggest that a previously unrecognized effect of PTEN loss is to reduce the potential restraint on cell growth and proliferation provided by activation of AMPK. This mechanism would also be expected to operate in tumour cells in which Akt is hyperactivated due to activating mutations in subunits of PI3K, or mutation or overexpression of upstream receptors [XREF_BIBR]. Previous evidence suggests that this mechanism also operates in human hepatoma (Huh-7) cells infected with the hepatitis C virus [XREF_BIBR], where PI3K is activated due to association with a non-structural protein encoded by the viral RNA [XREF_BIBR]. In that case, expression of viral proteins was reduced by treating the infected Huh-7 cells with AMPK activators such as AICAR (5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside) or metformin [XREF_BIBR].\n\n",

        "text":"Finally, our results suggest a molecular mechanism by which prior phosphorylation at Ser 487  inhibits subsequent phosphorylation of Thr 172 , and hence activation, by upstream kinases. In a partial α1β2γ1 complex containing rat α1, which was expressed in bacteria and where Ser 485  was therefore most likely unphosphorylated, the ST loop from Glu 469  to Val 524  was not resolved, indicating that it was mobile within the crystal [XREF_BIBR]. Our hypothesis is that the ST loop interacts with residues within the kinase domain when Ser 487  is phosphorylated, hindering the ability of upstream kinases to gain access to Thr 172 . This hypothesis is supported by the results in XREF_FIG, showing that a peptide corresponding to the sequence from Arg 466  to Asp 525  on human α1 inhibits activation and Thr 172  phosphorylation of an α1β2γ1 complex by LKB1, but only when phosphorylated on the residue corresponding to Ser 487 . This is an extremely specific effect, because the phosphopeptide had no effect on the activation or phosphorylation by LKB1 of BRSK2, which (with BRSK1) has the kinase domain most closely related to AMPK-α1 and AMPK-α2 within the human kinome.\n\n",

        "text":"The 54 residues of the ST loop in human AMPK-α1 contains 15 serine residues (including Ser 487 ) and five threonine residues, most of which are conserved in α1 subunits from other vertebrates and in C. elegans                          . It has been shown recently that GSK3β phosphorylates the ST loop at multiple sites, with site-directed mutagenesis suggesting that the initial phosphorylation was at Thr 481 , followed by Ser 477  and perhaps Thr 473  (human α1 residue numbering; in rats the equivalent residues are Thr 479 , Ser 475  and Thr 471 ). Thr 481  phosphorylation was proposed to inhibit net Thr 172  phosphorylation by enhancing its sensitivity to dephosphorylation [XREF_BIBR]. With most substrates, phosphorylation by GSK3 requires \u2018priming\u2019 by another kinase, because the kinase usually phosphorylates a serine or threonine residue located four residues N-terminal to an existing phosphoamino acid [XREF_BIBR]. In the case of AMPK it was proposed that phosphorylation of Ser 487  on rat AMPK-α1 might promote phosphorylation of Thr 481 , although not by conventional priming because the residue spacing is not appropriate, and because phosphorylation was not affected by a GSK3β mutation that reduces phosphorylation of primed substrates [XREF_BIBR]. If the hypothesis by Suzuki et al. [XREF_BIBR] is correct, phosphorylation of Ser 487  may lead to additional phosphorylation events within the ST loop. This might explain why we observed a larger effect on AMPK activation and Thr 172  phosphorylation by modulation of Akt in intact cells than in cell-free assays (compare XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG with XREF_FIG\u2013XREF_FIG). Although GSK3β was phosphorylated at Ser 9  in response to Akt treatment and this normally inhibits GSK3 activity [XREF_BIBR], this inhibition does not occur with \u2018unprimed\u2019 substrates [XREF_BIBR] as proposed for Thr 481  [XREF_BIBR]. Thus it is possible that phosphorylation of Ser 487  in our intact cell experiments promoted additional phosphorylation events, such as phosphorylation of Thr 481  and Ser 477  by GSK3.\n\n",

        "text":"As an extension of this hypothesis, we propose that the side chains of three basic residues located in the αC helix of the small lobe of the kinase domain (Arg 64 , Lys 71  and Arg 74  in human α1) interact with multiple phosphate groups attached to the ST loop, thus anchoring the ST loop to the kinase domain and blocking access of Thr 172  to upstream kinases. Interestingly, although at least one of these (Arg 64  or Lys 71 ) is conserved in all 12 AMPK-related kinases, none are conserved in the archetypal serine/threonine kinase domain of PKA. Consistent with our hypothesis, a human α1β2γ1 complex containing an \u2018AAA\u2019 mutation (R64A/K71A/K74A) was completely resistant to the ability of previous Akt phosphorylation to reduce the rate of Thr 172  phosphorylation by LKB1 (XREF_FIGD). Also consistent with this model was our finding that prior Akt phosphorylation reduced activation by both upstream kinases (LKB1 and CaMKKβ) to very similar extents (XREF_FIGC). Final confirmation of this model will require structural analysis of AMPK complexes where the ST loop is present in a phosphorylated form, rather than being unphosphorylated or deleted as in existing structures [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR].\n\n",

It is already known from retrospective studies that treatment of diabetics with metformin is associated with a lower incidence of cancer compared with other medications [XREF_BIBR,XREF_BIBR], although it is not yet certain that this effect is mediated by AMPK.
