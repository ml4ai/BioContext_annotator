      "text":"\n\nWe recently found evidence that STAT1 in esophageal squamous carcinoma (ESCC) cells exerts tumor suppressor function, and it regulates five key regulators of apoptosis or cell-cycle progression, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, survivin, cyclin D1 and p21. In this study, we confirmed these findings in four ESCC cell lines. Using immunohistochemistry, we also assessed the expression of these proteins in 62 primary tumors. The expression of these markers was heterogeneous, ranging 39 to 69% of the cohort. Significant correlation was found between STAT1 and three proteins (p21, Bcl-xL and survivin), whereas only a trend was identified for cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. We then correlated the expression of these proteins with several clinicopathologic parameters including lymph node metastasis, depth of invasion, clinical stage and overall survival. Significant correlations were found between Bcl-2 and deep invasion (p\u200a=\u200a0.033), survivin and lymph node metastasis (p\u200a=\u200a0.006), as well as cyclin D1 and clinical stage (p\u200a=\u200a0.014). Patients with p21-positive tumors had a significantly longer survival compared to those with p21-negative tumors (p\u200a=\u200a0.031). To conclude, our findings support the concept that STAT1 exerts its tumor suppressor effects in ESCC via modulating the expression of key regulators of apoptosis and cell-cycle progression.\n\n\n\n",

        "text":"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most deadly cancers. This disease is highly prevalent in the Chaoshan area in China, with the annual average, age-standardized incidence rate being 10-folds higher than that of most places worldwide XREF_BIBR. While it has been suspected that genetic and/or environmental factors may predispose the Chaoshan population to ESCC, the pathogenesis of ESCC remains to be elusive. Recently, we studied the biological signficance of STAT1 in ESCC, since STAT1 has been shown to promote apoptosis and carry tumor suppressor functions in different types of cancers XREF_BIBR. In support of the concept that STAT1 is a tumor suppressor in ESCC, we found that STAT1 expression is commonly lower in ESCC tumors (67 of 131, 51.1%), as compared to case-matched normal tissue; importantly, a relatively low level of STAT1 expression in ESCC was found to be significantly correlated with a worse clinical outcome, tumor invasion and tumor size XREF_BIBR. In the same study, gene transfection of STAT1C (a constitutively-activated form of STAT1) into two ESCC cell lines (EC1 and EC109), resulted in significant apoptosis, and this biological change correlated with a marked reduction in the expression of several anti-apoptotic proteins and a cell-cycle facilitator (including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL survivin and cyclin D1) as well as an upregulation of p21 Waf1 , a negative regulator of G1 cell-cycle progression XREF_BIBR. With this background, we hypothesize that STAT1 may mediate its tumor suppressor function in ESCC by modulating the expression of these anti-apoptotic proteins and cell-cycle regulators. While some of these markers have been previously studied in ESCC regarding their clinical significance (e.g. prognosis), their relationship with STAT1 expression in ESCC has not been explored. In this study, we first confirmed the relationship between STAT1 and these five markers in four additional ESCC cell lines. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC), we assessed if the correlation between STAT1 and these markers also hold true in a cohort of patient samples. We also assessed if these markers correlate with various clinicopathologic parameters including the overall survival.\n\n",

Decreased or loss of STAT1 expression has been observed in many types of cancer such as breast cancer, melanoma and leukemia XREF_BIBR\u2013XREF_BIBR. One of our recent studies has revealed evidence that the expression of STAT1 is frequently decreased in ESCC, and this abnormality significantly correlates with a worse clinical outcome XREF_BIBR. Correlating with this clinical observation, our prior in-vitro studies using two ESCC cell lines have provided evidence that STAT1 carries tumor suppressor functions in ESCC. Specifically, we found that gene transfection of STAT1C into ESCC cell lines effectively induced apoptosis, and this finding was associated with the substantial down-regulation of several pro-survival proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin, as well as modulation of two G1 cell-cycle regulatory proteins, p21waf1 and cyclin D1.\n\n",

Based on our findings, we concluded that the correlation between STAT1 and these five markers are consistent among all six ESCC cell lines examined (two from our previous study and four from the current study). Importantly, these correlations hold true in patient samples for p21, Bcl-xL and survivin. In addition, a trend was observed between STAT1 and Bcl-2, as well as between STAT1 and cyclin D1, and the statistical significance may have been reached if more cases were included.\n\n",

We found that Bcl-2 expression significantly correlated with a long survival in our study. While this finding may appear to be counter-intuitive, we have found another published report describing similar finding in a cohort of ESCC patient samples XREF_BIBR. However, the correlation of Bcl-2 expression and the survival of ESCC patients is not without controversy. We are aware of two reports describing that Bcl-2 expression in primary-resected ESCC correlates with a worse clinical outcome in these patients XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Furthermore, two other reports suggest that Bcl-2 expression is not related to tumor progression nor the prognosis in ESCC XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. The reason for these discrepancies is likely multi-factorial, but it may be related to the fact that caspases can cleave Bcl-2 into a pro-apoptotic molecule. Thus, in the presence of caspase activation, Bcl-2 is pro-death; in contrast, in the absence of caspase activation, Bcl-2 is pro-survival.\n\n",

This over-expression is often associated with decreased apoptosis in tumors, resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and a poor clinical outcome. Down-regulation of Bcl-xL by siRNAs was found to suppress cell growth and induce apoptosis in ESCC cells XREF_BIBR. Moreover, ESCC patients with high Bcl-xL expression were found to have a significantly shorter survival than those with low Bcl-xL expression XREF_BIBR. Nonetheless, we found that Bcl-xL expression did not correlate with any of the examined clinical parameters or prognosis in this study. Again, the relatively small number of patient samples included in this analysis may have contributed to the lack of statistical significance. Nonetheless, the possibility of technical difference (e.g. the choice of anti-Bcl-xL and/or antigen retrieval methods) may have accounted for this discrepancy.\n\n",

Several studies suggest a correlation between the expression of surviving and a short survival in ESCC patients XREF_BIBR. Interestingly, the subcellular location of survivin appears to be important prognostically in ESCC, since nuclear expression was found to have a negative impact whereas cytoplasmic expression has no prognostic relevance XREF_BIBR. In the present study, we found that survivin correlates with lymph node metastasis and late clinical stage, but has no correlation with the overall survival. The lack of prognostic significance is contradictory with the previous findings that over-expression of survivin in ESCC correlates with poor prognosis XREF_BIBR\u2013XREF_BIBR. The reasons for this discrepancy may be due to the small sample size and a relatively short follow up. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up may help to clarify this issue.\n\n",

Upregulation of cyclin D1 has been shown to shorten the G1 phase and is linked to development and progression of many types of cancer, such as breast cancer, gastric cancer and mantle cell lymphoma XREF_BIBR\u2013XREF_BIBR. P21 is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that directly inhibits the activity of the cyclin D1/CDK4 complex. In ESCC, cyclin D1 expression has been shown to be associated with a worse prognosis XREF_BIBR. However, several studies demonstrate that cyclin D1 is an independent prognostic factor in ESCC, with high cyclin D1 expression having a more favorable prognosis than patients with low cyclin D1 expression XREF_BIBR. High expression of p21has been shown to correlate with better survival and predicted the response to chemoradiotherapy XREF_BIBR. The role of p21 as a tumor suppressor is not without controversy. A report has shown that p21 expression correlates with a poor clinical outcome in ESCC patients XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Our study demonstrates that expression of cyclin D1 is associated with lymph node metastasis and the clinical stage of ESCC, but p21 nuclear staining has no significant correlation with the survival. Although these results may not be persuasive because of the small sample size, several studies on ESCC also support our findings of a lack of significant correlation between p21 expression and different clinicopathological parameters among ESCC patients XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR.\n\n",
