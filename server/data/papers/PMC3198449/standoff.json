      "text":"\n\nBcl-X L , an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, plays a central role in the regulation of the apoptotic pathway. Heterodimerization of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins with the proapoptotic family members such as Bad, Bak, Bim and Bid is a crucial step in the apoptotic regulation. In addition to these conventional binding partners, recent evidences reveal that the Bcl-2 family proteins also interact with noncanonical binding partners such as p53. Our previous NMR studies showed that Bcl-X L : BH3 peptide and Bcl-X L : SN15 peptide (a peptide derived from residues S15-N29 of p53) complex structures share similar modes of bindings. To further elucidate the molecular basis of the interactions, here we have employed molecular dynamics simulations coupled with MM/PBSA approach. Bcl-X L  and other Bcl-2 family proteins have 4 hydrophobic pockets (p1\u2013p4), which are occupied by four systematically spaced hydrophobic residues (h1\u2013h4) of the proapoptotic Bad and Bak BH3 peptides. We observed that three conserved hydrophobic residues (F19, W23 and L26) of p53 (SN15) peptide anchor into three hydrophobic pockets (p2\u2013p4) of Bcl-X L  in a similar manner as BH3 peptide. Our results provide insights into the novel molecular recognition by Bcl-X L  with p53.\n\n\n\n",

The MD simulation protocol that we used is as follows. Hydrogens were added and the protonation state of ionizable groups was chosen appropriate to pH 7.0. Each system was inserted in a water box of TIP3P water, which extended at least 12 Å away from any given protein atom. All systems were neutralized by adding counter ions and replacing the overlapping solvent molecules. The size of each system utilized for the simulations are represented in XREF_TABLE. All simulations were run under periodic boundary conditions with NPT ensemble by using Berendsen's coupling algorithm for maintaining the temperature (300 K) and the pressure constant (1 bar). The SHAKE algorithm with a tolerance of 10 −5  Å was applied to fix all bonds containing hydrogen atoms. The electrostatic interactions were calculated by using the Particle-mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm, with interpolation order of 4 and a grid spacing of 0.1 nm and the van der Waals forces were treated by using a cutoff of 10 Å. A 2-fs time step was used to integrate the equations of motion. The systems were subjected to steepest descent energy minimization for 2,000 steps. Then the protein backbone was frozen and the solvent molecules with counter ions were allowed to move during a 200 ps position restrained MD run.

The RMSD was calculated during production phase using the respective initial minimized structure as the reference structure. The average RMSD value for MDM2/P53 complex simulation was 0.12 nm which is consistent with previous computational simulation studies XREF_BIBR. For the Bcl-X L /peptide (SN15, Bad and Bak) simulations the average RMSD values was between 0.28 nm to 0.32 nm. The Bcl-X L /SN15 mutant (W23A) peptide simulation showed bit higher RMSD average values (0.4 nm), which can be expected due to changes in the peptide secondary structure and overall fluctuations of protein structure. Comparatively high fluctuations were observed at the long flexible loop of Bcl-X L  located between α1 and α2 and also other loops which connect the α-helices. These observations suggest that there is no significant structural drift in each system during the MD simulations (XREF_FIG). Secondary structural analysis was carried out to measure the stability of the simulations. These analysis shows that the α-helices present in the MDM2 as well as Bcl-X L  persist throughout the simulation time (XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY\u2013XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY). The short β-strands present in the MDM2 structures also maintained their size (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY).

DSSP analysis revealed that all the peptides indeed preserve their helical content and in several simulations there is an increase by 2\u20133 residues (XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY\u2013XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY).

This hydrogen bond is observed between NEε of tryptophan and main chain carbonyl of L54. Another conserved hydrophobic residue L26 of p53 interacts with I99 side chain. Our results are also consistent with previous experimental and computational findings and corroborate that these three hydrophobic residues of p53 are determinants for MDM2 binding. Apart from these three crucial interactions several other residues also helps for the firm binding such as L22, P27 and T18. The residue L22 of p53 interacts with V93 and H73 of binding partner. Proline residue (P27) present on the p53 peptide forms van der Waals interactions with Y100 of MDM2.\n\n",

The residual contribution analysis of Bcl-X L /SN15 simulation postulated that indeed these three residues of the SN15 peptide are major contributors for binding with protein (XREF_TABLE). These three hydrophobic residues of SN15 occupy three hydrophobic pockets (p2\u2013p4) in a similar manner as BH3 peptides (XREF_FIG). The residue L26 of SN15 superimposes well on equivalent residue leucine which is well conserved in all the BH3 peptides.

The central hydrophobic residue tryptophan (W23) of SN15 resides at the p3 hydrophobic binding pocket and interacts strongly with surrounding hydrophobic residues like F97 and A142. A stable hydrogen bond is observed between epsilon nitrogen atom of tryptophan and main chain carbonyl of E96. This could be the possible reason for larger contribution of binding energy of this residue for complex formation. The point mutation (W23A) simulation results produced around 10 kcal/mol less enthalpy (ΔH) compare to the wild type peptide simulation which is in good agreement with experimental data (XREF_TABLE and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY).

Another residue Q16 forms several hydrogen bond interactions with E96, R100 of α2 helix. Though the SN15 peptide forms several hydrophilic residues, it lacks the charged residues at appropriate positions like Bad/Bak. SN15 peptide has a negatively charged residue (D21) that is conserved even in Bad and Bak peptides. Although, it is in a conserved position, due to the binding orientation of SN15 peptide the distance between the complimentary residue (R139) of Bcl-X L  and D21 of SN15 is high and is unable to reach and establish either hydrogen bond or salt bridge. Salt bridge as well as hydrogen bonding interactions was observed with aspartate residue (D12) which is present at equivalent position of Bak peptide. The calculated minimum distance between the side chains of aspartate residue of SN15, Bak (D21, D12 respectively) and arginine (R139) residue of Bcl-X L  is around 0.7 nm which is not optimal for any type of interaction. In the case of Bak, though the side chains are far at initial stages of the simulation but around 2 ns time the distance of the side chains reduced to around 0.2 nm and is sustained throughout the simulation (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY).

These differences largely arise due to the length and helical nature as well as binding orientation of the different peptides (XREF_FIG). The Bad peptide covers maximum surface of the Bcl-X L  binding pocket and is composed of both hydrophobic as well as charged residues. Bak and SN15 peptides occupy comparatively less space due to their length. Nevertheless, all three peptides (Bad, Bak and SN15) interact with the conserved hydrophobic pocket residues.

Key hydrophobic residues of p53 peptide (F19, W23 and L26), which are crucial for MDM2 binding occupy the hydrophobic patch of Bcl-X L  in an identical manner as Bad and Bak peptides. Though the SN15 satisfies the hydrophobic contribution similar to BH3 peptides, lack of charged interactions with the either sides of Bcl-X L  binding cavity walls leads to a modest binding affinity. The tryptophan residue of SN15 contributes dominantly for complex formation and forms both hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions at third hydrophobic pocket of Bcl-X L . This residue contributes better than equivalent residues of BH3 peptides (M15, I10 of Bad and Bak peptides respectively). Analogous interaction pattern was observed between W23 of p53 and MDM2. This anchoring interaction of tryptophan in both complexes could be one of the reasons for susceptibility for mutational changes which causes decrease or total loss of binding XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR. Recent evidence of nutlin-3 binding in Bcl-X L  substantiated the importance of tryptophan or tryptophan mimics for dual target binding XREF_BIBR.
