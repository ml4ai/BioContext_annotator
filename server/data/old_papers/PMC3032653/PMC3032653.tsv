2	uaz:UA-CT-30006	epithelial cells	c1			Signalling by the GTPase RhoA , a key regulator of epithelial cell behaviour , can stimulate opposing processes : RhoA can promote junction formation and apical constriction , as well as reduced adhesion and cell spreading , .
3						Molecular mechanisms are thus required that ensure spatially restricted and process specific RhoA activation .
4						For many fundamental processes , including assembly of the epithelial junctional complex , such mechanisms are still unknown .
5						Here we show that p114RhoGEF is a junction associated protein that drives RhoA signalling at the junctional complex and regulates tight junction assembly and epithelial morphogenesis .
6			e2	c1	p114RhoGEF is required for RhoA activatio	p114RhoGEF is required for RhoA activation at cell-cell junctions , and its depletion stimulates non junctional Rho signalling and induction of myosin phosphorylation along the basal domain .
7			e3	c1	 GEF-H1 , a RhoA activator	Depletion of GEF-H1 , a RhoA activator inhibited by junctional recruitment , does not reduce junction associated RhoA activation .
8			e4,e5,e6	c1	p114RhoGEF associates with a complex containing myosin II , Rock II and the junctional adaptor cingulin	p114RhoGEF associates with a complex containing myosin II , Rock II and the junctional adaptor cingulin , indicating that p114RhoGEF is a component of a junction associated Rho signalling module that drives spatially restricted activation of RhoA to regulate junction formation and epithelial morphogenesis .
9						A particular RhoGTPase can be part of signalling mechanisms that stimulate opposing processes and , at a given point in time , may be activated at one subcellullar site and inactivated at another .
10						Orchestration of RhoGTPase signalling thus requires mechanisms that regulate activity in space and time , .
11			e7,e8	c1	Activation of GTPases is catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and inactivation by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) , .	Activation of GTPases is catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) and inactivation by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) , .
12						In epithelial cells , the RhoGTPase family member RhoA is activated at cell junctions upon initiation of cell-cell adhesion and , concomitantly , downregulated in other parts of the cells , contributing to reduced cell spreading and stress fibre formation , and inhibition of proliferation - .
13						Junctional RhoA activation drives formation of tight and adherens junctions , and is required to maintain junctional integrity , processes that are mediated by the actinomyosin cytoskeleton ; however , how RhoA is activated at junctions is not understood .
14			e9	c1	 Rho stimulated transcription factor ZONAB	GEF-H1 , a GEF for RhoA , localises to tight junctions , the most apical component of the junctional complex ; yet , it is not required for junction formation , and junctional recruitment leads to its inactivation and inhibition of the Rho stimulated transcription factor ZONAB , , .
15						GEF-H1 activation is indeed required for junction dissociation .
16						We identified p114RhoGEF as a regulator of epithelial differentiation and junction assembly using a functional siRNA screen .
17						A p114RhoGEF specific antibody was found to detect a 114kD protein that disappeared upon transfection of specific siRNAs in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2 and in immortalised human corneal epithelial ( HCE ) cells .
18						By immunofluorescence , this antibody stained the junctional complex and a cytoplasmic pool .
19						Both stainings disappeared upon p114RhoGEF depletion .
20						Junctional p114RhoGEF overlapped with occludin , a tight junction protein , but not E-cadherin , an adherens junction component , indicating that p114RhoGEF associates with the apical junctional complex and tight junctions .
21			e10,e11	c2	p114RhoGEF is a widely expressed gene and , in vitro , functions as a specific activator of RhoA - .	p114RhoGEF is a widely expressed gene and , in vitro , functions as a specific activator of RhoA - .
22	uaz:UA-CLine-8216	hce cells	c2	c2	Accordingly , depletion of p114RhoGEF resulted in reduced levels of active RhoA	Accordingly , depletion of p114RhoGEF resulted in reduced levels of active RhoA in HCE cells without significantly affecting Rac and Cdc42 .
23						We next determined the effect of p114RhoGEF depletion on the junctional complex by staining for tight and adherens junction markers .
24						In the columnar epithelial cell line Caco-2 , p114RhoGEF depletion resulted in flatter cells and in a warped appearance of the junctional staining of ZO-1 and , to a lesser degree , beta-catenin , as well as reduced perijunctional f-actin and increased formation of stress fibres .
25						The phenotype of HCE cells was similar but , as these are not columnar , no flattening was observed .
26						Strikingly , ZO-1 staining was disrupted , indicating a defect in tight junction assembly .
27						Comparable phenotypes were observed when cells were stained for other tight junction markers and when p114RhoGEF was depleted with individual siRNAs or a different type of siRNA pool .
28						p114RhoGEF is thus required for normal junction formation and actin organisation .
29						We next investigated if Caco-2 cells depleted of p114RhoGEF form functional epithelial barriers by testing the permeability properties of the monolayers .
30						We performed calcium switch assays to monitor de novo junction formation and measured transepithelial electrical resistance , a measure of barrier integrity .
31						Depletion of p114RhoGEF strongly attenuated barrier formation and only reached 40 % of the values of control cultures .
32						Paracellular diffusion of fluorescent 4 and 70 kD dextran was still high in such cultures , indicating that tight junctions remained leaky .
33						Morphological analysis of cells incubated for different times with calcium revealed that p114RhoGEF depletion did not affect initial spreading and initiation of cell-cell contacts as ZO-1 accumulated at forming junctions already after 1 hour and f-actin staining revealed spread cells .
34						However , ZO-1 staining remained discontinuous and warped even after 24 hours .
35						Similar observations were made for other junctional markers .
36						Thus , p114RhoGEF is not required for spreading and initiation of adhesion , but for junctional maturation .
37						As expected , GEF-H1 depleted cells spread more slowly as round cells were still detected after 1 hour with calcium but , once junctions started to form , they established morphologically normal junctions .
38						GEF-H1 depletion did also not affect junction formation in HCE cells .
39						This is in agreement with previous observations indicating that GEF-H1 is not required for junction formation but cell spreading , , .
40						p114RhoGEF localised to forming junctions already after 30 minutes together with myosin II , a target of Rho signalling during junctional maturation .
41						Myosin II recruitment to cell contacts was attenuated by 114RhoGEF depletion and , instead , showed increased association with stress fibres .
42						GEF-H1 was also not recruited to cell contacts and may hence contribute to the increase in stress fibres along the base of the cells , .
43						We next analysed whether p114RhoGEF regulates epithelial morphogenesis using three-dimensional culture systems that allow the formation of polarised cysts with a central lumen .
44						p114RhoGEF was depleted by siRNA transfection in Caco-2 cells and expression of shRNAs in MDCK cells .
45						Depletion affected both epithelial cell types , resulting in a disorganised appearance of the cysts that often developed multiple lumens and an irregular distribution of ZO-1 .
46						The apical marker podocalyxin still accumulated in lumens , suggesting p114RhoGEF depletion did not cause a loss of polarity but a disorganised three-dimensional arrangement of the cells .
47						We next investigated whether p114RhoGEF stimulates Rho signalling at the junctional complex .
48						We used a FRET ( Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer ) - based RhoA biosensor to localise RhoA activation in live cells after depletion of either p114RhoGEF or , as an additional control , GEF-H1 .
49						In control cells , the most intense FRET signal , indicating active RhoA , was observed along cell-cell junctions .
50						Depletion of p114RhoGEF led to a redistribution of the FRET signal away from cell junctions and was increased throughout the cells including the basal domain .
51						Depletion of GEF-H1 did not affect the junctional FRET signal .
52						Comparable results were obtained with HCE and Caco-2 cells as well as during junction formation , indicating that p114RhoGEF is required for spatially restricted RhoA activation at cell junctions .
53			e12,e13	c3,c4	One of the main targets of RhoA signalling is phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin II ( MLC ) , leading to myosin activation .	One of the main targets of RhoA signalling is phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin II ( MLC ) , leading to myosin activation .
54						Therefore we next investigated the role of p114RhoGEF in MLC phosphorylation .
55						In control cells , myosin staining was found along the junctional complex and , to a lesser extent , along the basal membrane .
56						Depletion of p114RhoGEF led to a redistribution of myosin from junctions to stress fibres .
57						Phosphorylated MLC was found along cell junctions in control cells and concentrated on stress fibres in the absence of p114RhoGEF , indicating that myosin activation was shifted to the basal domain .
58						GEF-H1 depletion did not affect the distribution of phosphorylated MLC .
59			e14	c3,c4	p114RhoGEF also inhibited the appearance of phosphorylated MLC	Depletion of p114RhoGEF also inhibited the appearance of phosphorylated MLC during junction assembly , indicating that it is required for myosin activation during junction formation .
60	uaz:UA-CLine-750,uaz:UA-CLine-8216	caco-2 cells, hce cells	e15,c3,c4	c3,c4	 phosphorylated MLC i	p114RhoGEF depletion did not alter total levels of phosphorylated MLC in Caco-2 cells and only slightly reduced them in HCE cells .
61						Phosphorylation of the Rock substrate myosin light chain phosphatase was also unaltered .
62						These observations suggest that p114RhoGEF is required for the spatially restricted activation of RhoA signalling and myosin activation at cell-cell junctions , and that its absence leads to defective junction assembly , cell spreading , increased non junctional RhoA signalling and myosin activation .
63						If p114RhoGEF regulates activation of junctional myosin , overexpression should induce junctional actinomyosin contraction and this should require a functional GEF domain .
64						Hence , we substituted a conserved tyrosine residue in the Dbl domain necessary for GEF activity ( p114RhoGEFY260A ) .
65						Analogous mutations were previously shown to inactivate the GEF activities of GEF-H1 and Lbc , .
66			e16,e17	c3,c4	VSV tagged p114RhoGEF had increased active RhoA levels and increased levels of phosphorylated MLC	Cells expressing VSV tagged p114RhoGEF had increased active RhoA levels and increased levels of phosphorylated MLC whereas expression of the mutant had no effect .
67						Morphologically , expression of p114RhoGEF-VSV led to an apically contracted , rounded morphology with increased perijunctional f-actin .
68	uaz:UA-CLine-5690	MDCK cells	e18,e19,c5	c5	upregulation of the active p114RhoGEF led to increased phosphorylated MLC	In stably transfected MDCK cells , upregulation of the active p114RhoGEF led to increased phosphorylated MLC at cell junctions .
69						Expression of active , but not inactive p114RhoGEF led to Rock activity dependent rounding and monolayer contraction leading to monolayer gaps .
70						Cell compaction was particularly striking in the normally flat HCE cells , which developed an apically elongated , dome like appearance with a contracted junctional ring , but was also evident in Caco-2 cells .
71						These effects required Rho activation as they were not observed when p114RhoGEFY260A-VSV was expressed .
72						Similarly , only active human p114RhoGEF could induce recruitment of junctional markers in depleted MDCK cells , and expression of the inactive exchange factor in HCE cells interfered with the normal junctional distribution of ZO-1 .
73						Overexpression of GEF-H1 did not induce contraction of the perijunctional actinomyosin ring .
74						These data indicate that junctional contraction is a p114RhoGEF specific function and requires a functional GEF domain .
75						As p114RhoGEF regulates the junctional recruitment of myosin , we next tested whether the two proteins are part of a common complex .
76			e20	c3,c4,c5	p114RhoGEF immunoprecipitates contained myosin IIA and the RhoA effector Rock II .	p114RhoGEF immunoprecipitates contained myosin IIA and the RhoA effector Rock II .
77			e21,e22,e23	c3,c4,c5	Cingulin , a tight junction associated adaptor known to form a complex with myosin and to regulate RhoA signalling , was also coprecipitating with p114RhoGEF , .	Cingulin , a tight junction associated adaptor known to form a complex with myosin and to regulate RhoA signalling , was also coprecipitating with p114RhoGEF , .
78						Coprecipitation of myosin IIA , cingulin and RockII was not detected when cells were not allowed to form junctions by culturing in low calcium medium .
79						Cingulin can also bind GEF-H1 ; however , coprecipitation of the two GEFs was not observed ( not shown ) , suggesting that they are part of distinct complexes .
80						We next used GST fusion proteins of p114RhoGEF to map the domain of p114RhoGEF required for these interactions .
81			e24,e25,e26	c3,c4,c5	We found that full-length p114RhoGEF pulled down myosin IIA , cingulin and Rock I	We found that full-length p114RhoGEF pulled down myosin IIA , cingulin and Rock II ; however , the efficiency was low possibly because the full length fusion protein was difficult to express .
82						The PH domain alone pulled down myosin and cingulin efficiently .
83						Pull down of Rock II was not efficient , suggesting that Rho activation might be needed for efficient Rock recruitment .
84						We next asked whether cingulin is required for recruitment of p114RhoGEF to tight junctions .
85						Depletion of cingulin indeed inhibited junctional recruitment of p114RhoGEF .
86	uaz:UA-CLine-8216	hce cells	c6			In HCE cells , cingulin was required for tight junction formation : depletion led to a loss of junctional staining not only of p114RhoGEF , but also of ZO-1 , occludin and GEF-H1 , but not of components of adherens junctions .
87						Cingulin and p114RhoGEF also colocalised by confocal microscopy , and overexpression of cingulin led to a redistribution of p114RhoGEF and myosin .
88			e27,e28,e29	c6	Cingulin depletion also attenuated p114RhoGEF and myosin IIA recruitment , and MLC phosphorylation	Cingulin depletion also attenuated p114RhoGEF and myosin IIA recruitment , and MLC phosphorylation at forming junctions .

90			e33	c8,c9	Cingulin is thus important for the cellular distribution of p114RhoGEF and for activation of RhoA signalling at cell junctions .	Cingulin is thus important for the cellular distribution of p114RhoGEF and for activation of RhoA signalling at cell junctions .
91						Our study shows that p114RhoGEF regulates spatially restricted activation of RhoA at epithelial junctions , driving junction assembly and junctional actinomyosin activation .
92						RhoA signalling is well-known to be a crucial regulator of junction assembly and function ; however , the GEF that activates RhoA at cell junctions had thus far not been known .
93						p114RhoGEF forms a functional signalling module containing Rock II and myosin , two proteins that are known to regulate junction dynamics , .
94						Junctional recruitment requires cingulin , an adaptor protein that is known to impact on RhoA signalling , .
95						p114RhoGEF regulates spatially restricted RhoA activation at cell-cell contacts in different types of epithelial cells .
96						In agreement with previous results , depletion of GEF-H1 , which is not required for junction formation and is inactive at junctions , did not affect junctional Rho signalling , .
97						Hence , p114RhoGEF and GEF-H1 represent two opposing pathways of RhoA regulation at cell junctions : the former is recruited to the forming junctional complex and promotes junctional maturation and contraction of the actinomyosin belt ; the latter is recruited and turned off , contributing to inhibition of confluence induced RhoA signalling and cell proliferation .
98			e34,e35,e36	c8,c9	Depletion of p114RhoGEF did not only inhibit RhoA activation at junctions , but led to increased non junctional Rho activation and increased MLC phosphorylation along the basal domain .	
99						Paradoxically as this may seem , it supports the specificity of p114RhoGEF for junctional Rho signalling and its importance for junction formation .
100						RhoA activity is downregulated in response to cell confluence ; hence , interfering with junction formation stimulates RhoA signalling in the rest of the cell .
101						As junctions do not form normally in p114RhoGEF depleted cells , GEF-H1 is also not recruited normally and , hence , is likely to contribute to overall RhoA activation in such cells .
102						GEF-H1 indeed induces stress fibres in response to stimuli such as TNFalpha , .
103						However , there are other mechanisms that contribute to inhibition of RhoA signalling at cell confluence , such as regulation of p190RhoGAP or , possibly , the junction associated GAP myosin-IXb , and depletion of GEF-H1 in addition to p114RhoGEF was not sufficient to block stress fibre formation ( not shown ) .
104						The junction associated actinomyosin cytoskeleton is crucial for the regulation of junction dynamics and function , and also drives apical constriction and tissue remodeling .
105			e37	c8,c9	p114RhoGEF thus associates with and activates a Rho signalling module that is central to epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis .	p114RhoGEF thus associates with and activates a Rho signalling module that is central to epithelial junction formation and morphogenesis .
106						This is supported by our data that shows p114RhoGEF regulated junction assembly and epithelial morphogenesis in three-dimensional culture systems .
107						Overexpression of p114RhoGEF induced actinomyosin contraction , suggesting that this Rho GEF may also be important for developmental processes requiring apical constriction .
108						Our data thus show that p114RhoGEF represents a RhoA regulator central to epithelial barrier formation and morphogenesis that forms a junction associated signalling module .
109						Given the physiological roles of junctional RhoA signalling , it will be important to determine how p114RhoGEF becomes stimulated during physiological and developmental processes to drive spatially restricted Rho signalling at cell junctions .

192						( a-c ) Caco-2 cells transfected with control or two different pools of p114RhoGEF specific siRNAs ( OnT refers to the On-Target pool ) were trypsinised and plated onto filters in low calcium media for 24 hours to prevent forming of cell-cell contacts .
193						Expression of p114RhoGEF and other junctional proteins was assayed at the end of the experiment by immunoblotting .
194						Uncropped images are shown .
195						Normal calcium containing medium was added and cell contact formation was monitored during the next 48 hours by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance ( b , shown are averages + /- 1SD , n = 3 ) .
196						Paracellular tracer permeability was then determined using fluorescently labelled dextrans ( c , shown are averages + /- 1SD , n = 3 ) .
197						( d - h ) Cells transfected with siRNAs and plated in low calcium followed by incubations in normal calcium were processed for immunoblotting ( d , 24 hours of calcium , uncropped images are shown ) or fixed at the indicated times and processed for immunofluorescence analysis using an epifluorescence microscope ( e , ZO-1 ; f , f-actin ; g , p114RhoGEF and myosin IIA ) .
