9						introduction
10						adhesion and migration of epithelial sheet be critical for wound healing , organ integrity , and morphogenetic movement during development .
11						cellular circuit that orchestrate these process require coordination of integrin function with multiple signaling pathway .
12						integrin be transmembrane heterodimeric receptor for ecm that convey information bi-directionally between the extracellular environment and intracellular signaling machinery .
13						engagement of integrin lead to the concentration of tyrosine kinase and they substrate at focal adhesion , a type of adheren junction that act as a signaling nexus , a tethering site for actin filament , and a region for generation of traction force during cell migration .
14						during drosophila embryogenesis , lateral epidermal sheet migrate to close a hole in the dorsal epidermis in the process of dorsal closure ( dc ) .
15						dc be execute through cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell shape change with no accompany cell division .
16						because many protein involve in dc also function in epithelial migration in other organism , dc have emerge as a ideal model system to dissect the mechanism drive migration and fusion of epithelial sheet .
17						during dc , structure relate to focal adhesion be assemble at the lead edge ( LE ) of advance lateral epithelial cell and integrin be concentrate at these site .
18						moreover , genetic analysis have reveal that integrin be essential for normal dc .
19						base on the established role of integrin in mammalian system , these adhesion receptor could influence dc by support cell-substratum interaction , modulate signaling pathway , or both .
20						one signaling cascade that be essential for successful execution of dc result in activation of c-jun amino-terminal kinase ( jnk ) .
21						fine tuning of jnk output be critical , as both attenuation and hyper-activation of jnk signaling result in a failure of dc .
22						the formation of focal adhesion complex at the apical border of the le cell during dc depend on proper modulation of the jnk cascade , highlight the potential importance of crosstalk between integrin and jnk signaling .
23						several cytoplasmic protein that colocalize with integrin be know to be essential mediator of integrin function in mammalian system .
24						one of these , the lim protein pinch , interact with the integrin link kinase ( ilk ) and be critical for adhesion and spreading of mammalian cell .
25						to elucidate the in vivo role and mechanism of action of pinch , we undertake a genetic analysis of pinch function .
26						drosophila pinch be encode by the steamer duck ( stck ) locus .
27						Mosaic analysis have reveal a critical role for pinch in integrin dependent epithelial cell adhesion in the adult wing .
28						homozygous zygotic stck mutant die late in embryogenesis , exhibit deficit in both muscle cell adhesion and actin-membrane anchorage .
29						involvement of pinch in both integrin mediate adhesion and actin-membrane linkage make it a attractive candidate for coordination of integrin and jnk function during dc .
30						result and discussion
31						to determine if pinch could contribute to dc , we examine its localization in stage 14 embryo .
32	uaz:UA-CT-30007,uaz:UA-ORG-252	le, amnioserosa	t2,t3,e4	t3,t2,s1	 consistent with pinch 's established role as a integrin effector	pinch and beta-p integrin be colocalize in both the LE and the amnioserosa ( a ) , consistent with pinch 's established role as a integrin effector .
33						the amnioserosa be a extraembryonic tissue present on the dorsal surface of the embryo .
34						as it have be establish that coordinate signaling between the amnioserosa and migrate epithelium be key to formation of LE focal complex , pinch could exert a effect in the LE epithelium , the amnioserosa , or both tissue .
35						stck homozygous mutant embryo rescue with a pinch : gfp transgene under the control of the endogenous pinch promoter display pinch-gfp at the LE of the advance epithelial sheet .
36						within the LE , PINCH be precisely localized to area of active phosphotyrosine signaling at triangular node correspond to apical adheren junction ( b , inset ) .
37						Figure 1 .
38						pinch function in dc and colocalize with beta-p integrin and phosphotyrosine .
39						( a ) confocal image of w1118 embryo show pinch ( green ) , beta-integrin ( magenta ) , and they merge ( white ) highlight the LE ( arrow ) and amnioserosa ( asterisk ) .
40						Inset show a single z-slice and confirm colocalization .
41						( b ) confocal image of p [ w+ gfp-pinch ] stck18 and l ( 3 ) 097 embryo show pinch : gfp ( green ) , phosphotyrosine ( magenta ) , and they merge ( white ) .
42						Inset : magnification of the LE illustrate concentration of pinch at apical junction .
43						( c ) cuticle of embryo carry stck17 loss-of-function allele both maternally and zygotically display pucker ( leave , arrow ) and dorsal hole ( right , arrow ) .
44						analogous stck18 embryo have the same array of phenotype .
45						control flp-frt embryo with wild-type pinch be fully viable .
46						bar : 20 mum ( a ) , 100 mum ( b and c ) .
47						zygotic stck mutant proceed normally through dc with complete lethality arise at the embryo-to-larval transition .
48						when maternal pinch contribution be eliminate , only 12 % of cuticle have wild-type morphology .
49						dorsal pucker and dorsal hole ( c ) characteristic of aberrant dc be observe at a 36 and 23 % frequency , respectively ( n = 180 ) , indicate that maternally inherit pinch be a key contributor to the process of dc .
50						moreover , in the absence of maternal pinch , we also observe epithelial defect in ventral patterning and head involution , indicate that pinch may have additional function in the develop embryo .
51						cuticle from embryo lack both maternal and zygotic pinch have the same array of phenotype .
52						pinch be compose of five lim domain , each of which could serve as a protein binding interface .
53						the sh2-sh3 adaptor protein , nck2 , have be report to interact with mammalian pinch .
54	taxonomy:7215	drosophila	s2,e5	s2	 Dreadlocks , interact directly with misshapen ( Msn ) , a map4k in the jnk signaling cascade .	this association be intriguing because the drosophila homologue of nck2 , Dreadlocks , interact directly with misshapen ( Msn ) , a map4k in the jnk signaling cascade .
55						as with other component of the jnk pathway , null mutation in msn result in embryonic lethality due to failure of dc .
56						although we be unable to detect direct binding of pinch to Dreadlocks in drosophila , we uncover a link between pinch 's role in dc and the jnk cascade by testing for genetic interaction between stck and msn .
57			e6	s2	 pinch function as a negative regulator of jnk signaling .	reduction of pinch protein level by introduction of a single copy of the loss-of-function allele , stck18 , into the msn102 homozygous null background allow partial restoration of dc ( p = 0.003 ; a ) , suggest that pinch function as a negative regulator of jnk signaling .

71						during dc , jnk regulate expression of a puc-lacz fusion reporter be restricted to the le cell ( b ) .
72						in embryo lack maternal pinch , expression of the puc-lacz fusion protein be disorganize and present in a expanded number of cell , include those beyond the LE border ( b ) .
73			e9	s2	 pinch in the negative regulation of the jnk cascade .	this phenotype be similar to puc-lacz expression observe in puc loss-of-function mutant and further support a role for pinch in the negative regulation of the jnk cascade .
74						Thorax closure be a post-embryonic developmental process with feature common to dc , include migration of epithelial sheet and a dependence on jnk signaling .
75						within the wing disc , cell of the stalk region be functionally similar to le cell during dc .
76						these cell comprise the eventual fusion site for adjacent imaginal disc and be active in jnk signaling .
77						spatially restricted jnk signaling in the stalk of wing disc can be visualize via a puc-lacz reporter , and pinch expression overlap with puc-lacz in this area of active jnk signaling ( c ) .
78						therefore , as in dc , pinch be properly position to act as a regulator of the jnk cascade .
79						although msn null mutation be embryonic lethal due to dc failure , fly homozygous for the hypomorphic allele msn3349 be semi-viable and a large proportion of the eclose adult have thorax closure defect ( d ) .
80						these observation underscore the similarity between thorax closure and dc .
81						in a stck18 heterozygous background , a greater percentage of msn3349 homozygote be able to eclose ( p < 0.0001 ; d ) , support the hypothesis that pinch be a negative regulator of the jnk pathway in both dorsal and thorax closure .
82						we purify drosophila pinch in complex with its bind partner use tandem affinity purification ( tap ) - tag pinch ( tap-pinch ; ) .
83						stck homozygous mutant embryo rescue with a tap : pinch transgene drive by the endogenous stck promoter to wild-type level ( a ) afford material for purification of soluble , cytoplasmic tap-pinch complex in the absence of endogenous pinch protein .

108						consistent with the view that they interact in vivo , pinch : gfp and rsu-1 be prominently colocalize at integrin rich muscle attachment site in drosophila embryo ( e ) .
109						drosophila rsu-1 , which display seven leucine rich repeat with high sequence similarity to small gtpase regulator , be encode by the cg9031 locus .
110						we have characterize a p-element insertion allele that disrupt the rsu-1 code sequence ( a ) .
111						fly homozygous for this mutation within cg9031 be viable and fertile ( unpublished datum ) , and lack rsu-1 protein as indicate by western analysis with multiple anti-rsu-1 antibody ( b ) .
112						pinch and rsu-1 be both express in larval wing disc ( c ) and similar to stck wing clone , the mutation within cg9031 produce fly with wing blister ( d ) at 60 % penetrance .
113						these datum be consistent with pinch and rsu-1 acting in concert to support integrin dependent adhesion .
114						we have name the cg9031 gene icarus ( ic ) after the son of Daedalus who have unstable wing .
115						Figure 4 .
116						ic encode rsu-1 .
117						( a ) the gene encode rsu-1 , located on chromosome 2 at cytological position 34c6 , comprise three exon ( code region shaded ) .

119						( b ) western blot of third instar larval extract use antibody direct against the amino or carboxy terminus of rsu-1 .
120						( c ) pinch and rsu-1 be express in wing disc .
121						( d ) ic homozygote display wing blister .
122						although elimination of rsu-1 function do not result in dorsal or thorax closure defect ( unpublished datum ) , we evaluate the role of rsu-1 in these process by testing for genetic interaction between ic and msn .
123						similar to what occur with reduction of stck dosage ( a ) , homozygous mutation of ic suppress dc defect observe in msn102 mutant embryo ( p < 0.001 ; a ) .
124						absence of rsu-1 also increase eclosure rate ( p < 0.0001 ) of msn3349 hypomorph ( b ) and completely suppress the thorax defect present in msn3349 animal ( unpublished datum ) , suggest that like pinch , rsu-1 can function as a negative regulator of jnk signaling .
125						to confirm that the suppression of msn dc defect by ic mutation be mediate by the jnk signaling cascade , we eliminate rsu-1 in basket ( bsk ) embryo that lack zygotic jnk , the terminal kinase in this cascade .
126						homozygous ic mutation suppress the dc defect of bsk1 mutant ( p < 0.001 ; c ) , confirm that ic loss-of-function mutation affect dc by influence the jnk cascade .
127						moreover , wing disc isolate from ic mutant display a 30 % increase in active phospho-jnk relative to wild type ( d ) , provide direct biochemical confirmation that rsu-1 influence jnk activation state in vivo .
128						although we have not detect any localized accumulation of rsu-1 during dc ( unpublished datum ) , rsu-1 be readily detect by western analysis in stage 13 embryo that be undergo dc ( e , lane 1 ) .
129						thus , the temporal pattern of rsu-1 expression be consistent with genetic result that highlight its role in regulation of jnk dependent morphogenesis .

137						( f ) propose model for pinch action in jnk and integrin signaling .
138						analysis of pinch and rsu-1 level in wild-type versus stck or ic mutant embryo provide insight into the physiological significance of they association .
139						in embryo mutant for both maternal and zygotic stck , rsu-1 be dramatically reduce relative to wild-type level ( e , lane 2 ) .
140						likewise , in ic embryo , pinch level be also decrease ( e , lane 3 ) .
141						these observation suggest that pinch and rsu-1 be reciprocally dependent on each other for maximal expression and and or stability .
142						the mechanism for coordinate regulation of rsu-1 and pinch remain to be determine .
143						because the phenotype associate with loss of rsu-1 represent a subset of stck phenotype , the process disturb in ic mutant may be exquisitely sensitive to pinch level .
144						alternately , rsu-1 may have function that be independent of its role in pinch stabilization .
145						we datum be consistent with a model ( f ) in which pinch could modulate jnk signaling in two distinct way .
146			e22	s7	pinch be present at area where jnk be active and antagonize jnk signaling .	first , pinch be present at area where jnk be active and antagonize jnk signaling .

148						pinch have no intrinsic catalytic activity , but might recruit protein that could alter the availability or activity of jnk signaling component .
149						like Puc , pinch expression be up regulate in response to constitutive jnk signaling .
150						availability of rsu-1 at these site of active jnk signaling could independently regulate jnk signaling or modulate the effect of pinch on jnk through regulation of pinch stability .
151						second , pinch and rsu-1 be require for integrin dependent adhesion .
152						pinch have previously be show to link integrin to the actin cytoskeleton via ILK and Parvin , and these connection could influence both integrin dependent adhesion and signaling .
153						integrin signaling , through a variety of tyrosine kinase and rac , stimulate the jnk cascade ; therefore , pinch may also exert a influence on jnk signaling via integrin .
154						we finding illustrate that the cellular concentration of pinch affect the level of rsu-1 and vice versa .
155	taxonomy:7215	drosophila	s8			thus , modulation of the ratio of rsu-1 to pinch could provide a mechanism to regulate jnk signaling during dc and thorax closure in drosophila .
156			e24	s8	 pinch and rsu -1 complex	we hypothesize that pinch and rsu -1 complex fine-tune and integrate the jnk and integrin signaling cascade require during morphogenesis , highlight the potential role of integrin associate apical junctional complex as signal coordination point for epithelial morphogenesis .
