12			e3	c1	wish activate arp2 and 3 complex through n-wasp-dependent and -independent pathway without cdc42	these finding suggest that wish activate arp2 and 3 complex through n-wasp-dependent and -independent pathway without cdc42 , result in the rapid actin polymerization require for microspike formation .
13						introduction
14						Ash and grb2 be a adaptor protein compose of one central src homology ( sh ) 2 domain and two flanking sh3 domain .
15						the sh2 domain of Ash and grb2 receive signal from several upstream target protein include egf receptor , pdgf receptor , shc , and insulin receptor 1 ( irs1 ) through binding to the specific phosphotyrosine contain motif on the target protein .
16						signal receive at the sh2 domain be transmit downstream through sh3 domain binding protein .
17						a recent study have show that the sh3 domain of Ash and grb2 bind to a variety of proline rich protein include Sos , synaptojanin ( : ) , dynamin , c-cbl , abl , ack , and neural wiskott-aldrich syndrome protein ( n-wasp ) .
18						thus , Ash and grb2 appear to play important role not only in mitogenic signaling through ra activation but also in the reorganization of actin filament and endocytosis .
19						it be already well know that the rho family of small g protein , include rho , rac , and cdc42 , act as molecular switch by cycling between the active gtp bind and the inactive gdp bind state to regulate the actin cytoskeleton .
20						rho primarily regulate development of actin stress fiber ; rac stimulate formation of lamellipodium or membrane ruffling ; and cdc42 induce the formation of filopodium .
21						"downstream signal from Ash and grb2 be find to "" cross-talk "" with these g protein , result in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton ."
22						indeed , n-wasp , a Ash and grb2 binding protein , induce filopodium formation that be dependent on cdc42 .
23						N-WASP possess a gtpase binding domain/cdc42/rac interactive binding region ( gbd and crib ) motif through which n-wasp bind directly to the active form of cdc42 .
24						we have also show that the verprolin homology domain ( v ) of n-wasp , which be a actin binding site , be essential for filopodium formation , and the cofilin like domain ( c ) and acidic ( a ) region in the cooh terminus of n-wasp be arp2 and 3 complex binding site .
25						furthermore , it have be show that arp2 and 3 complex be markedly activate by the verplorin homology , cofilin homology , and acidic region ( vca ) region of n-wasp .
26						this be the minimal essential region for the activation of arp2 and 3 complex .
27						however , the full-length n-wasp protein be find to be a less potent activator of arp2 and 3 complex than the vca protein , suggest that the vca region be mask in the full-length protein and be expose by interaction with other activate factor .
28						thus far , addition of cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ( pip2 ) have be show to increase the activity of full-length n-wasp to the level induce by vca protein .
29						recently , other vca region contain protein have be identify and name WASP family verplorin-homologous protein ( WAVE ) / scar .
30						wave appear to function downstream of rac and induce membrane ruffling .
31						thus , it have be make clear that WASP and WAVE family protein can bind and activate arp2 and 3 complex through the vca region , result in rapid actin polymerization .
32						in this study , we identify a novel Ash and grb2 binding protein that contain a sh3 domain , sh3 binding proline rich sequence , and a leucine zipper like motif .
33			e4	c2	wish bind n-wasp through its sh3 domain .	we name this protein WASP interact sh3 protein ( wish ) , because wish bind n-wasp through its sh3 domain .
34			e5,e6	c2	 wish further enhance n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation	in addition , we demonstrate that wish further enhance n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation independent of cdc42 in vitro .
35	uaz:UA-CLine-100020	cos7 cell	c2			furthermore , coexpression of wish and n-wasp induce marked formation of microspike in cos7 cell even in the absence of stimulus , and a n WASP mutant ( h208d ) that can not bind cdc42 also induce microspike formation when coexpress with wish .
36	tissuelist:TS-0095	brain	e7,t3	t3	 WISH have a alternative route in addition to the route via n-wasp , to activate arp2 and 3 complex	use n-wasp-depleted brain extract , we also show that WISH have a alternative route in addition to the route via n-wasp , to activate arp2 and 3 complex in brain extract induce rapid actin polymerization .

134						the molecular mass of this protein be the same as that of the endogenous protein ( 90 kd ) from rat brain ( c ) , indicate that the cdna clone encode the full-length wish protein .
135						tissue distribution of wish
136						to examine the tissue distribution of WISH , we perform northern hybridization analysis with total rna from various rat tissue .
137						as show in a , wish mrna ( 2.8 kb ) be express predominantly in brain and testis .

149						the two band above the Ash and grb2 band in a be the light chain of the anti-myc antibody .
150						we then examine whether endogenous wish associate with Ash and grb2 by immunoprecipitation with anti-wish antibody use n1e-115 cell lysate .

158						as show in a , several protein be find to coprecipitate specifically with wish .
159						among they , the band at 65 kd be particularly strong .
160						we postulate that this protein be n-wasp , because n-wasp be a 65-kd protein and possess a proline rich region that may serve as a target for the WISH sh3 domain .
161						to confirm this possibility , we examine anti-wish immunoprecipitate with various antibody against protein such as so , c-cbl , synaptojanin , and WAVE that contain proline rich region .

170			e23	c6	wish bind specifically to n-wasp	because wish bind specifically to n-wasp , we examine whether WISH could further stimulate n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation in vitro .
171						actin polymerization can be monitor with pyrene label actin , a fluorescent derivative of actin that exhibit higher fluorescence intensity when actin be assemble into filament .
172						use a cell-free system , we measure the effect of n-wasp and wish on arp2 and 3 complex induce actin polymerization .
173						all protein use in this experiment be show in a .
174						the gst-vca fusion protein of n-wasp ( vca ) markedly activate arp2 and 3 complex induce actin polymerization ( b ) as describe previously ( Rohatgi et al. .
175						, 1999 ) .
176						in contrast , full-length n-wasp be not as potent as vca .
177						addition of gst-cdc42 fusion protein ( cdc42 ) to n-wasp in this system increase arp2 and 3 complex induce actin polymerization to the level evoke by vca in the presence of pip2 ( datum not show ) , but addition of cdc42 without pip2 do not increase activity to that of vca ( b ) .
178						surprisingly , addition of gst-wish fusion protein ( wish ) to n-wasp increase the arp2 and 3 complex induce actin polymerization to the level induce by vca even in the absence of cdc42 .
179						addition of cdc42 do not increase activity any further ( b ) .
180			e24	c6	wish do not activate arp2 and 3 complex directly without n-wasp ( b ) .	wish do not activate arp2 and 3 complex directly without n-wasp ( b ) .
181						we then check whether gst fusion protein of other sh3 protein such as Ash and grb2 ( Ash ) , fyn , nck , Ash and grb2 nh2-terminal sh3 domain ( ashn ) , p85 , and plcgamma1 ( plcgamma ) also activate arp2 and 3 complex as well .
182			e25,e26,e27	c6	Ash and ashn stimulate n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation 	Ash and ashn stimulate n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation ( c ) as describe previously , but they be less effective than wish .

186					thus , wish be find to be the strongest activator of n-wasp	thus , wish be find to be the strongest activator of n-wasp among the sh3 protein examine .
187						interestingly , cdc42 be not necessary for the activation to the level induce by vca .
188						this activation be detect only with the sh3 domain of WISH ( c ) .
189						basic protein that do not contain sh3 domain , such as myelin basic protein ( mbp ; Upstate Biotechnology ) , do not activate n-wasp at all , suggest that activation be not merely due to ionic interaction ( c ) .
190						we further examine the concentration dependent effect on actin polymerization ( d ) .
191						both sh3 domain of wish and full-length wish increase the initial actin polymerization rate in a concentration dependent manner , and they activation potency be higher than those of other sh3 domain , such as ashn and fyn .
192						thus far , it have be think that the n-wasp vca region , which be mask under rest condition , be expose by binding of cdc42 to the gbd and crib motif of n-wasp .
193			e34	c6	wish alone can expose the vca region of n-wasp by bind to the proline rich region of n-wasp independent of cdc42 .	take together , these result present the idea that wish alone can expose the vca region of n-wasp by bind to the proline rich region of n-wasp independent of cdc42 .

195						addition of cdc42 to extract of neutrophil or xenopus oocyte induce a increase in actin polymerization .
196						in addition , WASP dependent actin comet have also be show to be form in bovine brain extract ( Yarar et al. 1999 ) .
197						thus , we further apply bovine brain extract instead of purify protein to examine the involvement of WISH in actin polymerization under a condition that more closely reflect the in vivo situation .
198						addition of bovine brain extract induce actin polymerization in the presence of cdc42 .
199						to address whether WISH , n-wasp , or arp2 and 3 complex contribute to actin polymerization activity in brain extract , WISH , n-wasp , and arp2 and 3 complex be deplete with anti-wish antibody , anti-n-wasp antibody , and gst-ca protein treatment , respectively ( a ) .
200						in wish deplete extract , 90 % of WISH be remove , whereas n-wasp level remain constant ( a ) .
201						approximately 98 % of n-wasp or 95 % of arp2 and 3 complex be remove in the respective deplete extract .
202						these depleted extract be use to examine the role of arp2 and 3 complex , n-wasp , and WISH in brain extract induce actin polymerization .
203						addition of cdc42 or wish to mock treated extract increase initial actin polymerization markedly , but fyn sh3 do not ( b , a ) .
204						on the other hand , the maximal actin polymerization level that be attain up to 100 min be similar for Mock , Mock + cdc42 , and Mock + WISH ( datum not show ) , suggest that wish activate the initial rate of actin polymerization .
205						as expect , cdc42 , WISH , and wish-sh3 activate the initial actin polymerization rate ( b , b ) .
206						arp2 and 3 complex be essential for brain extract induce actin polymerization , because addition of cdc42 or wish to arp2 and 3 complex deplete extract do not restore activity ( c , a and b ) .
207						add back of arp2 and 3 complex do restore polymerization activity ( datum not show ) .
208						wish depletion do not affect basal activity without cdc42 ( d , a and b ) , but addition of excess WISH to WISH deplete extract increase actin polymerization activity ( , da and db ) .
209						N-WASP depletion also do not affect basal actin polymerization activity , but addition of wish to n-wasp-depleted extract increase the activity significantly ( e , a and b ) , although addition of cdc42 increase the activity only slightly .
210						these finding suggest that wish activate arp2 and 3 complex not only in a n-wasp-dependent manner but also in a n-wasp-independent manner .
211						wish and n-wasp induce Microspike formation cooperatively in Vivo
212						to examine whether WISH stimulate n-wasp-induced microspike formation , wish and n-wasp be coexpress in cos7 cell .
213	uaz:UA-CLine-100020	cos7 cell	c7			expression of wish or n-wasp alone do not cause any morphological change in cos7 cell ( a ) .
214						in response to egf stimulation , however , n-wasp-expressing cell form microspike , whereas wish expressing cell do not .
215						when WISH and n-wasp be coexpress , microspike formation be induce even in the absence of egf ( b ) , though the structure of actin filament be also alter .
216						to clarify whether cdc42 be necessary for n-wasp-induced microspike formation when WISH be present , we use a n WASP mutant ( h208d ) that can not bind cdc42 .
217						h208d alone be not able to induce microspike formation even in the presence of egf ( c , top panel ) .
218						however , coexpression of h208d and wish do induce microspike formation ( c , bottom panel ) .
219						real-time observation by phase-contrast microscopy reveal that these microspike be filopodium but not retraction fiber ( d ) .
220						the number of cell that form microspike be also increase by coexpression of wish and n-wasp or wish and h208d ( e ) .
221			e35	c7	wish alone have a ability to activate n-wasp	all these result indicate that wish alone have a ability to activate n-wasp to induce microspike formation without the aid of cdc42 .
222						discussion
223						wish be a novel adaptor protein that activate n-wasp
224						wish be a 90-kd protein that contain one sh3 domain at the nh2 terminus and three sh3 binding site , which be proline rich sequence .
225			e36,e37,e38,e39,e40	c6	wish associate with sh3 domain in Ash and grb2 through these proline rich sequence ( c ) , but it also associate with the sh3 domain of plcgamma1 , fyn , nck , and pi 3-kinase 85-kd subunit in vitro .	wish associate with sh3 domain in Ash and grb2 through these proline rich sequence ( c ) , but it also associate with the sh3 domain of plcgamma1 , fyn , nck , and pi 3-kinase 85-kd subunit in vitro .
226						wish be probably recruit to the activated receptor for these protein in response to extracellular stimulus as a downstream molecule in tyrosine kinase signaling .
227						thus , wish be think to act as a adaptor protein that bind to sh3 domain of these protein .
228			e41	c6	the nh2 terminus of wish contain a sh3 domain and be show to form a complex with n-wasp .	the nh2 terminus of wish contain a sh3 domain and be show to form a complex with n-wasp .
229						binding through the wish-sh3 domain appear to be fairly specific because other proline rich protein such as so , synaptojanin , c-cbl , and WAVE , which be all know to bind various sh3 domain , do not bind wish ( b ) .
230			e42	c6	N-WASP can activate arp2 and 3 complex	N-WASP can activate arp2 and 3 complex through the vca region at its cooh terminus , result in rapid polymerization of actin ( Rohatgi et al. .
231						, 1999 ) .
232						the mechanism of n-wasp activation be explain as follow .
233			e43	c6	the vca region essential for arp2 and 3 complex activation be mask by a intramolecular interaction with the region contain the gbd and crib motif ( Miki et al. .	under rest condition , the vca region essential for arp2 and 3 complex activation be mask by a intramolecular interaction with the region contain the gbd and crib motif ( Miki et al. .
234						1998a ) .
235			e44	c6	when cell be stimulate , activate cdc42 bind to the gbd and crib motif .	when cell be stimulate , activate cdc42 bind to the gbd and crib motif .
236					this lead to the exposure of the vca region , where g-actin and arp2 and 3 complex be recruit .	this lead to the exposure of the vca region , where g-actin and arp2 and 3 complex be recruit .
237						consequently , actin polymerization be induce in the cortical area of cell , result in filopodium formation .
238						indeed , gst-vca protein remarkably activate arp2 and 3 complex induce actin polymerization , indicate that the vca region be the minimal essential region for arp2 and 3 complex activation .
239			e45	c6	activate cdc42 can only partially activate n-wasp 	however , it should be note that activate cdc42 can only partially activate n-wasp and require addition of pip2 to reach the activation level induce by gst-vca protein .
240			e46,e47	c6	n-wasp binding protein , WISH , can also expose the vca region of n-wasp and effectively enhance n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation ( b ) .	we show here that a n-wasp binding protein , WISH , can also expose the vca region of n-wasp and effectively enhance n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation ( b ) .
241						this activation be mediate by the binding through the sh3 domain of WISH , because the fusion protein contain the sh3 domain also have activate ability ( c ) .
242			e49,e48	c6	Ash and grb2 sh3 can also activate n-wasp but much less potently than wish-sh3 do	Ash and grb2 sh3 can also activate n-wasp but much less potently than wish-sh3 do ( c ) .
243					other sh3 element such as the sh3 of fyn , nck , plcgamma1 , and pi 3-kinase 85-kd subunit cause only weak activation of n-wasp ( c ) .	in addition , other sh3 element such as the sh3 of fyn , nck , plcgamma1 , and pi 3-kinase 85-kd subunit cause only weak activation of n-wasp ( c ) .
244						WISH activate arp2 and 3 complex induce Actin Polymerization Independent of cdc42
245			e52,e53,e54	c6	wish enhance n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation | wish enhance n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation	more interestingly , wish enhance n-wasp-induced arp2 and 3 complex activation to the level of gst-vca protein even in the absence of cdc42 ( b ) , suggest that binding of wish to n-wasp be sufficient for full activation .
246						it be know that brain extract induce WASP dependent actin comet formation .
247						in this case , addition of WISH instead of cdc42 also activate actin polymerization to the level induce by cdc42 ( b ) .
248						when WISH be add to n-wasp-depleted extract , such activation be still observe .
249						in contrast , addition of cdc42 to this system do not restore activity ( e ) .
250			e55	c6	wish activate arp2 and 3 complex	this suggest that wish activate arp2 and 3 complex through both n-wasp-dependent and -independent pathway and that cdc42 be not require for either pathway if wish be present .
251						WASP and n-wasp also bind several protein such as WIP and proline serine threonine phosphatase interact protein ( pstpip ) .
252						these protein may have n-wasp-activating activity as well , though they effect on n-wasp-induced activation of arp2 and 3 complex have not be examine .
253						possible role of WISH in neuronal cell
254						both wish and n-wasp be express predominantly in brain and neuronal cell .
255						furthermore , wish depletion experiment reveal that WISH be significantly involve in arp2 and 3 complex induce actin polymerization by brain extract ( d ) .
256						the axonal growth cone , which be a highly dynamic structure at the tip of the axon , consist of filopodial and lamellipodial protrusion that respond to both positive and negative external guidance cue .
257						consider the fact that coexpression of wish and n-wasp induce filopodium formation in cos7 cell , it may be possible that WISH also act for form filopodium in neural cell , in which filopodium formation have be show to be essential for neurite extension .
258						however , the precise function of WISH in neural cell remain to be clarify .
