20						introduction
21						the notch signaling pathway be essential for cell fate determination during embryogenesis and postembryonic development in multicellular organism .
22	"taxonomy:7215,taxonomy:6239"	"Drosophila, C. elegans"	"e8,e9,s4,s5"	"s4,s5"		"classical notch signaling begin with activation of the notch receptor by transmembrane dsl ligand ( Delta and Serrate in drosophila or lag-2 [ Lin and glp-2 ] in C. elegan [ - ] ) express on adjacent cell , result in proteolytic cleavage of the notch receptor , internalization of the ligand and receptor complex , and nuclear translocation of the notch ic ( intracellular ) domain [ - ] ."
23						"in the nucleus , the notch ic domain act as a transcriptional regulator together with a conserved transcription factor call Su ( h ) ( suppressor of hairless ) in drosophilum and lag-1 [ Lin and glp-1 ] in C. elegan ."
24						the molecular mechanism of notch signaling be highly conserve .
25						"vertebrate homolog exist for each of these component in the notch signaling pathway , and mutation in notch signaling have be implicate in various developmental disorder , include alagille and cadasil [ - ]"
26						"in C. elegan , the notch receptor lin-12 ( lineage defective-12 ) play critical role in cell fate specification in multiple tissue ."
27						the role of lin-12 in two step of vulval development have be particularly well study .
28						"first , lin-12 be require for cell fate specification of a anchor cell ( ac ) and a vulval uterine ( vu ) cell from the descendent of equipotent precursor cell z1 and z4 during the l1 larval stage [ - ] ."
29						"loss of lin-12 signaling generally result in the specification of two ac , whereas increase lin-12 signaling result in two vu cell ."
30						"the ac produce a diffusible epidermal growth factor ( egf ) signal that induce the primary ( 1degree ) cell fate in p6.p , one of six equipotent vulval precursor cell ( vpc ) ( review in ) ."

32						"loss of lin-12 signaling generally cause vpc to take on 1degree and tertiary ( 3degree ) fate , whereas strong lin-12 gain-of-function allele cause vpc to take on 2degree fate with consequent change in the fate of descendent cell that contribute to the adult vulva ."
33	taxonomy:7215	drosophila	"e10,s6"	s6		"canonical notch receptor ligand be exemplify by drosophila delta , which contain a conserve n-terminal dsl domain originally find in Delta , Serrate , and lag-2 protein ."

117						loss of osm-11 perturb cell Fate Specification during Vulval Development
118						we first examine the role of osm-11 in specification of the ac .

123						we next examine VPC specification .
124						"after ac specification , the ac produce the diffusible egf protein lin-3 that be require for induction of the 1degree cell fate in p6.p , one of six equipotent vpc ( review in ) ."
125						LIN-3 egf act via the well characterize ra and mapk ( mitogen activate protein kinase ) pathway in vpc .

127						"loss of egf signaling eliminate 1degree and 2degrees cell fate , whereas aberrantly increase egf/ras/map kinase signaling can cause all vpc to adopt the 1degree cell fate ."
128						"by contrast , loss of lin-12 notch signaling cause all vpc to take on 1degree or 3degree fate , whereas strong notch gain-of-function allele cause all six vpc to take on 2degree fate ( a ) ."

156						"strikingly , 69 % of osm-11 ( lf ) adult animal have a overtly defective vulva or retain egg , which correlate quantitatively with the loss of secondary cell fate observe with altered lin-11p : : gfp expression ."
157						loss of lin-11 expression at this stage suggest that secondary cell fate be either not properly specify or not maintain in osm-11 ( lf ) animal .

191						previously describe c. elegan dsl contain notch ligand also have temporally regulate expression pattern in the vpc .
192						"for example , base on reporter construct analysis , soluble dsl-1 be only express in p6.p and its descendent ."
193						OSM-11 expression in pn.p cell be consistent with a role for osm-11 in initial cell fate specification .
194						"like lin-12 notch receptor , osm-11 be primarily localized to the apical side of vpc ( b , inset ) ."
195						vpc be polarize epithelial cell ; egf and notch signaling normally occur in separate cellular compartment .
196						"Lethal-23 ( let-23 ) egf receptor be localized to the basolateral surface of the vpc in close proximity to the ac , which be the source of lin-3 egf ."

198	uaz:UA-CLine-100114	VPCs	"e16,c2"	c2		the apical localization of osm-11 in vpc during cell fate specification suggest that osm-11 be available to bind to lin-12 receptor in vpc at the time of cell fate specification .
199						osmotic stress response do not alter vulval cell Fate Specification
200						osm-11 and osm-7 be previously implicate in osmotic stress resistance .
201						pre-exposure of wild-type c. elegan to high external osmolarity be sufficient to induce osmotic resistance .
202						loss of either osm-7 or osm-11 allow animal to survive high external osmolarity without pre-exposure .
203						"the cellular and molecular mechanism underlie osmotic stress resistance in either scenario be poorly understand , but up regulation of gpdh-1 and increase level of the osmolyte glycerol have be implicate ."
204						"as loss of osm-11 increase glycerol level and increase osmolyte level can alter protein folding , osm-11 could act indirectly to decrease notch receptor signaling in VPC fate specification ."
205						"alternatively , osm-11 might act directly upon notch receptor involve in VPC fate specification ."
206						we experimental result below favor the latter model ; the role of osm-11 in vulval cell fate specification be distinct from the role of osm-11 in osmotic stress .
207						"if osmotic stress indirectly decrease notch receptor signaling , then vulval development should be alter by osmotic stress and alter by genetic background with increase osmotic stress resistance ."
208						we first test this hypothesis by raise wild-type animal under previously define osmotic stress condition : 200 and 400 mm nacl .
209						"rear under osmotic stress condition do not alter vulval morphology , and the cellular expression pattern of vulval cell lineage marker ( lip-1p : : gfp , egl-17p : : gfp , or lin-11p : : gfp ) in vpc be unchanged ( unpublished datum ) ."
210						we also examine genetic background previously implicate in osmotic stress resistance ; neither osr-1 nor daf-2 animal have alter vulval morphology [ - ] .
211						"in addition , we consider the possibility that osm-11 expression in the vulval cell precursor might be alter by osmotic stress ."
212						we find that rear under osmotic stress condition ( 400 mm nacl ) do not alter osm-11 protein level in vpc ( unpublished datum ) .
213						"combine , all of these datum suggest that osmotic stress do not itself regulate vulval development ."
214						"instead , these datum suggest that the role of osm-11 in vulval development and osmotic stress resistance be independent ."
215						OSM-11 be a secreted protein
216						"because the predicted peptide sequence of osm-11 contain a signal peptide , we test whether osm-11 be a secreted protein ."
217						"when a osm-11 cdna be express in drosophila s2 tissue culture cell , osm-11 protein accumulate in the media and not in cell ( a ) , consistent with osm-11 act in vivo as a soluble protein in the extracellular milieu ."
218						the ability of osm-11 to diffuse and act as a soluble factor in vivo be test by ectopically express osm-11 in non vpc cell in osm-11 ( lf ) animal .
219						osm-11 cdna be fuse to osm-10 or glr-1 promoter fragment that drive expression in nonoverlapping subset of neuron throughout larval development .
220						the osm-10 promoter drive expression in four class of sensory neuron located exclusively in the head and tail .
221						the glr-1 promoter drive expression in 17 other class of neuron ( distinct from osm-10-expressing neuron ) located in the head and tail .
222						some of the glr-1-expressing neuron have process in the ventral nerve cord near the vpc .
223						we find that neuronal expression of the osm-11 cdna significantly rescue osm-11 vulval defect to level comparable with osm-11 promoter drive cdna rescue ( b ) .
224						"consistent with these result , hypodermal expression of osm-11 cdna use the wrt-6 promoter also rescue osm-11 defect , albeit at a lower level ."
225						we conclude that osm-11 can act nonautonomously and that soluble osm-11 can diffuse in vivo .

238						osm-11 act upstream of lin-12 notch receptor activation to increase signaling
239						the phenotypic defect cause by loss of osm-11 might be due to osm-11 action upon previously identify molecular pathway that regulate cell fate specification in vulval development .
240						"we test the sensitivity of the egf , notch , and synthetic multivulva ( SynMuv ) VPC fate specification pathway to osm-11 level by rnaus knockdown of osm-11 in mutant that have be previously use as sensitize background for each pathway : lin-12 ( n137n460csgf ) notch ( see below ) , let-23 ( sa62gf ) egf receptor , let-60 ( n1046gf ) ra , or lin-15 ( n765tslf ) SynMuv [ - ] ."

242						"although it be difficult to assess the relative sensitivity of these various genetic background , these result suggest that notch signaling might be particularly sensitive to osm-11 level and that osm-11 might modulate lin-12 signaling during vulval development ."
