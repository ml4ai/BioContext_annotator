1						Afadin : A Novel Actin Filament binding Protein with One PDZ Domain Localized at Cadherin based Cell-to-Cell Adherens Junction
2						A novel actin filament ( F-actin ) - binding protein with a molecular mass of ~ 205 kD ( p205 ) , which was concentrated at cadherin based cell-to-cell adherens junction ( AJ ) , was isolated and characterized .
3						p205 was purified from rat brain and its cDNA was cloned from a rat brain cDNA library .
4						p205 was a protein of 1,829 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 207,667 kD .
5						p205 had one F-actin-binding domain at 1,631-1 ,829 aa residues and one PDZ domain at 1,016- 1,100 aa residues , a domain known to interact with transmembrane proteins .
6						p205 was copurified from rat brain with another protein with a molecular mass of 190 kD ( p190 ) .
7						p190 was a protein of 1,663 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 188,971 kD .
8						p190 was a splicing variant of p205 having one PDZ domain at 1,009-1 ,093 aa residues but lacking the F-actin-binding domain .
9						Homology search analysis revealed that the aa sequence of p190 showed 90 % identity over the entire sequence with the product of the AF-6 gene , which was found to be fused to the ALL-1 gene , known to be involved in acute leukemia .
10						p190 is likely to be a rat counterpart of human AF-6 protein .
11						p205 bound along the sides of F-actin but hardly showed the F-actin-cross-linking activity .
12						Northern and Western blot analyses showed that p205 was ubiquitously expressed in all the rat tissues examined , whereas p190 was specifically expressed in brain .
13						Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic studies revealed that p205 was concentrated at cadherin based cell-to-cell AJ of various tissues .
14						We named p205 l-afadin ( a large splicing variant of AF-6 protein localized at adherens junction ) and p190 s-afadin ( a small splicing variant of l-afadin ) .
15						These results suggest that l-afadin serves as a linker of the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane at cell-to-cell AJ .
16						In various cellular events , such as cell adhesion , cell motility , and cell shape determination , specialized membrane domains are formed with transmembrane proteins , such as cell adhesion molecules , receptors , and channels , and these domains are often associated with the actin cytoskeleton ( , ; ; ; ; , 1997 ; ) .
17						The linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane plays crucial roles in these cellular events , and proteins linking the actin cytoskeleton to the transmembrane proteins have been identified .
18						However , the molecular basis of the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane is not fully understood .
19						To understand this molecular linkage , the cell adhesion sites have most extensively been studied ( , ; ; ; ; , 1997 ; ) .
20						The actin filament ( F-actin ) 1 -associated cell adhesion sites are subclassed into two types : cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adherens junctions ( AJ ) .
21						Many linker proteins have been identified at cell-to-cell AJ where cadherins interact with each other at the extracellular surface .
22						The cytoplasmic domain of cadherin is associated with cytoplasmic proteins such as alpha - , beta - , and gamma-catenins .
23						alpha-Catenin directly interacts with F-actin .
24						alpha-Catenin also interacts indirectly with F-actin through alpha-actinin and and or ZO-1 .
25						Vinculin , another F-actin-binding protein , is concentrated at cell-to-cell AJ , although its interacting molecule at cell-to-cell AJ has not yet been identified .
26						At cell-to-matrix AJ where integrin interacts with matrix proteins at the extracellular surface , the cytoplasmic domain interacts directly or indirectly with F-actin-binding proteins , including alpha-actinin , vinculin , and talin .
27						Thus , many F-actin- binding proteins appear to serve as linkers of the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane cadherin and integrin .
28						The linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane is also important for neuron specific events , such as growth cone pathfinding and the subsequent formation and maintenance of synaptic junction .
29						However , it remains to be clarified which molecules link the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane in these neuron specific events .
30						To address this issue , we attempted to isolate novel F-actin-binding proteins from the rat brain by using a blot overlay method with 125 I labeled F-actin .
31					 F-actin-binding protein that is concentrated at synapse and named it neurabin .	We had isolated a neural tissue specific F-actin-binding protein that is concentrated at synapse and named it neurabin .
32					Neurabin has one F-actin- binding domain and one PDZ domain .	Neurabin has one F-actin- binding domain and one PDZ domain .
33						The PDZ domain has been found in a variety of proteins , some of which are localized at cell-to-cell junctions , such as PSD-95 / SAP90 at synaptic junction , Dlg at septate junction , and ZO-1 and ZO-2 at tight junction ( ; Gumbiner , 1991 ; ; ; ; ) .
34						Recent studies have revealed that the PDZ domain binds to unique COOH-terminal motifs of target proteins , which are found in a large number of transmembrane proteins , such as N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and Shaker-type K + channel .
35						It is likely , therefore , that neurabin serves as a linker of the actin cytoskeleton to a transmembrane protein ( s ) at the synapse although we have not yet identified its interacting transmembrane protein ( s ) .
36						Along this line , we further attempted to isolate other novel F-actin-binding proteins from rat brain .
37						Here , we isolated a novel F-actin-binding protein with a molecular mass of ~ 205 kD ( p205 ) .
38						p205 also had one F-actin-binding domain and one PDZ domain , and was localized at cadherin based cell-to-cell AJ .
39						During the purification of p205 , it was copurified with another protein with a molecular mass of 190 kD ( p190 ) that was a splicing variant of p205 having one PDZ domain but lacking the F-actin- binding domain .
40						Homology search analysis revealed that the amino acid sequence of p190 showed 90 % identity over the entire sequence with the product of the AF-6 gene , which has been found to be fused to the ALL-1 gene , known to be involved in acute leukemia .
41						We named p205 l-afadin ( a large splicing variant of AF-6 protein localized at adherens junction ) and p190 s-afadin ( a small splicing variant of l-afadin ) .
42						We describe here isolation and characterization of l-afadin .

74						After the column was washed with 6 ml of buffer A , elution was performed with a 30-ml linear gradient of NaCl ( 0.15-0 .4 M ) in buffer A. 0.5-ml fractions were collected .
75						The other half of the sample was subjected to Mono Q column chromatography in a similar manner .

85						The fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis was performed as described .
86						Briefly , the chromosomes were prepared from rat splenocytes , the R-band was stained with Hoechst 33258 , and the chromosomes were exposed to UV light .
87						After the cDNAs of clones 20 , 84 , and 94 were labeled with biotin 16-dUTP , the chromosomes were hybridized with these labeled cDNAs , and they were incubated with an antibiotin goat antibody and then with an FITC labeled anti-goat IgG antibody .

90						The full-length l-afadin cDNA corresponding to bp 326-5812 ( aa 1-1829 ) and its fragment corresponding to bp 326-5344 ( aa 1-1673 ) were inserted to the pCMV-myc vector using standard molecular biology methods .
91						The constructs were transfected to COS7 cells with the DEAE-dextran method .

93						The 597-bp fragment of the l-afadin cDNA corresponding to bp 5216-5812 ( aa 1631-1829 ) was inserted to the pGEX and pQE vectors .
94						These constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli , and the glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) fusion protein ( GST-l-afadin-C ) and the six histidine residues ( His6 ) - fusion protein ( His6-l-afadin-C ) were purified by use of glutathione-Sepharose and Ni-agarose , respectively .
95						F-Actin-binding and -cross linking Activities
96						Low shear viscometry was performed as described .
97						Briefly , alpha-actinin ( recombinant chick lung type ) or the Mono Q sample of l-afadin , including s-afadin , in an indicated amount was mixed with 0.28 mg and ml of G-actin in a solution containing 20 mM Tris and Cl , pH 8.0 , 0.25 mM EDTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 140 mM NaCl , 0.1 mM ATP , and 1 mM EGTA , and the solution was sucked into a 0.1-ml micropipette .
98						After the incubation for 1 h at 25degreesC , the time for a stainless steel ball to fall a fixed distance in the pipette was measured .
99						Cosedimentation of l-afadin with F-actin was performed as follows : G-actin was polymerized by incubation for 30 min at room temperature in a polymerization buffer ( 20 mM imidazol and Cl , pH 7.0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , and 90 mM KCl ) .
100						An indicated amount of GST-l-afadin-C or His6- l-afadin-C ( each aa 1631-1829 ) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.3 mg and ml of F-actin , and the mixture ( 100 mul ) was placed over a 50-mul cushion of 30 % sucrose in the polymerization buffer .
101						After the sample was centrifuged at 130,000 g for 20 min , the supernatant was removed from the cushion , and the pellet was brought to the original volume in an SDS sample buffer .
102						To quantitate cosedimentation of GST-l-afadin-C or His6-l-afadin-C , the comparable amounts of the supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE ( 15 % polyacrylamide gel ) , transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane , incubated with an antibody against l-afadin as described below , and then incubated with 125 I labeled protein A. Amounts of the free and bound fusion proteins were calculated by determining the radioactivity from the supernatant and pellet fractions with an image analyzer ( Fujix BAS-2000II ) .

143						Results
144						Purification of l-Afadin and Molecular Cloning of Its cDNA
145						To identify novel actin binding proteins , we attempted to detect actin binding proteins using a blot overlay method with 125 I labeled F-actin .
146						The soluble fraction of rat fetal brain was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by the blot overlay .
147						Several radioactive protein bands with various molecular masses were detected .
148						Of these F-actin-binding proteins , the protein band with a molecular mass of ~ 205 kD ( p205 ) was highly purified by column chromatographies , including Q-Sepharose , phenyl-5PW , hydroxyapatite , and Mono Q column chromatographies .
149						On the final Mono Q column chromatography , the F-actin-binding protein band well coincided with a protein with a molecular mass of ~ 205 kD that was identified by protein staining with Coomassie brilliant blue .
150						p205 was copurified with another protein with a molecular mass of ~ 190 kD ( p190 ) , and they could not be separated from each other by further column chromatographies , including Mono S and Superdex 200 column chromatographies ( data not shown ) .
151						These proteins appeared at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of > 600 kD on the gel filtration .
152						The Mono Q sample including p205 and p190 was used to study the biochemical properties of p205 as described below .
153						When the peptide mapping analyses of the Mono Q sample of these two proteins , p205 and p190 , were performed , their maps were almost identical , whereas p205 showed the additional peptide peaks .
154						When the aa sequences of the five peptide peaks common between the two proteins were separately determined , all the aa sequences of the p205 and p190 peptides were identical .
155						A computer homology search indicated that the aa sequences of the five peptide peaks were identical with or significantly homologous to those of human AF-6 protein .
156						When the aa sequences of the two peptide peaks specific to p205 were determined , they were not found in the current protein database .
157						These results suggest that p205 and p190 are related to human AF-6 protein , and that p190 is a splicing variant , a homologue , or a degradative product of p205 .
158						A rat brain cDNA library was screened using the degenerated oligonucleotide probes designed from the partial aa sequences of the seven peptide peaks described above .
159						We obtained several overlapping clones .
160						Among these clones , clone 20 contained a coding region with ~ 4.9 kb , but it lacked a predicted initiation codon .
161						The deduced aa sequence included all the aa sequences of the peptides of p205 .
162						This aa sequence analysis indicated that the aa sequences of the two peptides specific to p205 were both located in the COOH-terminal region .
163						Clone 94 contained a coding region with ~ 4.5 kb and an in-frame stop codon upstream of the stop codon of clone 20 .
164						This clone also lacked a predicted initiation codon .
165						The deduced aa sequence of the coding region included all the aa sequences of the peptides of p190 , but not those of the peptides specific to p205 .
166						Clone 84 contained a coding region with ~ 4.2 kb and a predicted initiation codon .
167						To confirm whether these cDNAs were derived from the same locus , we made the chromosomal assignment by FISH analysis using the cDNAs as probes .
168						All the cDNAs were localized on rat chromosome 1q12 .2 ( data not shown ) .
169						The full-length p205 and p190 cDNAs were constructed from clones 84 and 20 , and clones 84 and 94 , respectively .
170						When the p205 cDNA was transfected into COS7 cells and the cell extract was subjected to 125 I labeled F-actin blot overlay , the recombinant protein ( myc-l-afadin ) showed mobility similar to that of native p205 on SDS-PAGE , as well as 125 I labeled F-actin-binding activity .
171						The deletion mutant of p205 lacking the COOH-terminal 156 aa ( myc-l-afadinDeltaC ) did not show the 125 I labeled F-actin- binding activity .
172						A fusion protein of the COOH-terminal region of p205 ( 199 aa ) with GST ( GST-l-afadin-C ) showed the 125 I labeled F-actin-binding activity .
173						Based on these observations , together with the fact that the Mono Q sample of p205 indeed showed the F-actin- binding activity as described below , we have concluded that the p205 gene encodes a protein of 1,829 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 207,667 kD ( Gen Bank and EMBL / DDBJ accession number U83230 ) , of which the COOH-terminal 199 aa contributes to its F-actin-binding activity , and that the p190 gene encodes a protein lacking ~ 160 COOH-terminal aa ( GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ accession number U83231 ) and is a splicing variant of the p205 gene .
174						A computer homology search revealed that the aa sequence of p190 showed 90 % identity over the entire sequence with that of human AF-6 protein , while human AF-6 protein and p190 lacked the COOH-terminal region of p205 .
175						p190 is likely to be a rat counterpart of human AF-6 protein .
176						The COOH-terminal , F-actin-binding domain showed no significant homology to any known F-actin-binding protein .
177						Both p205 and p190 had one PDZ domain .
178						We named p205 and p190 l- and s-afadins , respectively .
179						Northern blot analysis using a sequence specific to the l-afadin cDNA as a probe detected ~ 7.5-kb mRNA in all the rat tissues examined , including the heart , brain , spleen , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , kidney , and testis .
180						A similar result was obtained when a sequence common between the cDNAs of l- and s-afadins was used as a probe ( data not shown ) .
181						Western blot analysis using an antibody specific to l-afadin detected an ~ 205-kD protein in all the rat tissues examined .
182						When an antibody recognizing both l- and s-afadins was used , however , an ~ 190-kD protein was detected only in the brain .
183						These results indicate that l-afadin is expressed ubiquitously while s-afadin is specifically expressed in brain .
184						The reason why the Northern blot analysis did not detect the two bands in the brain may simply be because of the similar length of the mRNAs of l- and s-afadins .
185						Biochemical Properties of l-Afadin
186						It was examined by competition experiments whether the Mono Q sample of l-afadin ( including s-afadin ) bound along the sides of F-actin or at its ends .
187						The binding of 125 I labeled F-actin to l-afadin was completely inhibited by an excessive amount of myosin S1 , a well characterized protein that binds along the sides of F-actin .
188						This inhibition was reversed by the addition of MgATP because MgATP dissociates the actin and myosin complex .
189						These results indicate that l-afadin binds along the sides of F-actin .
190						The effect of the Mono Q sample of l-afadin on F-actin was examined using the falling ball method for low shear viscometry .
191						This effect was compared to that of alpha-actinin , a well characterized protein that shows F-actin-cross-linking activity .
192						l-Afadin increased the viscosity of F-actin in a dose dependent manner , and the viscosity became maximal at approximately threefold .
193						alpha-Actinin also increased the viscosity , but the viscosity became unmeasurably high .
194						This effect of the Mono Q sample of l-afadin on F-actin was further assessed by transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained specimens .
195						l-Afadin hardly caused F-actin to associate into bundles and meshworks under conditions where alpha-actinin showed a marked F-actin-cross-linking activity ( data not shown ) .
196						This result was consistent with that of the low shear viscometry .
197						The stoichiometry of the binding of l-afadin to actin and the affinity constant were examined using His6- l-afadin-C .
198						The stoichiometry was calculated to be 1 His6- l-afadin-C molecule per ~ 500 actin molecules .
199						The kilodalton value was calculated to be the order of 10 -7 .
200						A similar result was obtained with GST-l-afadin-C ( data not shown ) .
201						The effect of the Mono Q sample of l-afadin on actin polymerization was finally examined using pyrene conjugated actin .
202						Pyrene conjugated actin is known to increase its fluorescent intensity with the actin polymerization .
203						l-Afadin did not affect the actin polymerization under the conditions where gelsolin stimulated it ( data not shown ) .
204						Localization of l-Afadin at Cadherin based Cell-to-Cell AJ
205						The localization of l-afadin was first examined by immunofluorescence microscopy of the frozen sections of various rat or mouse tissues using the anti-l-afadin antibody .
206						In the liver , l-afadin was localized at the beltlike junctional complex region along the bile canaliculi .
207						When the frozen sections of the small intestine were doubly stained with the monoclonal anti-E-cadherin , l-afadin was concentrated with E-cadherin at the junctional complex region of intestine absorptive epithelia , but l-afadin was more highly concentrated at the junctional complex region than E-cadherin .
208						The frozen sections of the heart were doubly stained with the monoclonal antivinculin antibody .
209						Vinculin is known to be a marker , not only for cell-to-cell AJ , but also for cell-to-matrix AJ .
210						l-Afadin was colocalized with vinculin at the intercalated disc .
211						Vinculin was also periodically located along the lateral borders of cardiac muscle cells ( costamere ) while l-afadin was not .
212						When the cultured EL cells expressing E-cadherin were doubly stained with the anti-ZO-1 antibody , l-afadin showed localization similar to that of ZO-1 .
213						ZO-1 is known to be concentrated at cadherin based , spotlike cell-to-cell AJ in fibroblasts .
214						These results suggest that l-afadin is localized at cadherin based cell-to-cell AJ .
215						To examine the precise localization of l-afadin at the junctional complex region , the frozen sections of small intestine were doubly stained with the monoclonal anti-ZO-1 antibody , and the bile canaliculi isolated from liver were doubly stained with the monoclonal antidesmoplakin antibody .
216						ZO-1 and desmoplakin are known to be markers for tight junction and desmosome , respectively .
217						In the absorptive epithelia , l-afadin was localized slightly more at the basal side than ZO-1 .
218						In the canaliculi , the localization of l-afadin did not coincide with that of desmoplakin .
219						These results indicate that l-afadin is localized at cell-to-cell AJ rather than at tight junction or desmosome .
220						The localization of l-afadin at cell-to-cell AJ was finally confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy of intestine absorptive epithelia using the silver enhancement and ultrathin cryosection techniques .
221						l-Afadin was associated with the undercoat of cell-to-cell AJ .
222						Discussion
223						Here , we isolated a novel F-actin-binding protein with a molecular mass of ~ 205 kD ( p205 ) .
224						This protein was copurified with another protein with a molecular mass of 190 kD ( p190 ) that lacked the F-actin-binding activity on various column chromatographies .
225						The molecular cloning of the cDNAs of these two proteins revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the p190 cDNA was identical to that of the p205 cDNA , except for the two splicing regions .
226						FISH analysis revealed that the genes of these two proteins were localized at the same locus .
227						These results suggest that p205 and p190 are splicing variants derived from the same gene .
228						Because a computer homology search revealed that the aa sequence of p190 was almost identical to that of human AF-6 protein , we theorize that p190 may be a rat counterpart of human AF-6 protein .
229						We named p205 and p190 l- and s-afadins , respectively .
230						Further purification steps of l-afadin , including Mono S column and Superdex 200 column chromatographies , did not separate l- and s-afadins from each other , and their elution profiles on these column chromatographies were similar but not identical .
231						These proteins appeared at a position corresponding to a molecular mass of > 600 kD on the gel filtration .
232						These results suggest that 1- and s-afadins form a complex , but we can not exclude the possibility that these two proteins do not form a complex , but instead are incidentally eluted at similar fractions on these column chromatographies .
233						It is , therefore , possible that the complex is composed of a heterooligomer alone , a homooligomer alone , or the mixture .
234						Western blot analysis indicated that the tissues other than brain expressed l-afadin alone .
235						It is likely that l-afadin forms a homooligomer in these tissues .
236						Recently , Luna 's group has shown that a protein with a molecular mass of ~ 205 kD in bovine neutrophils has the 125 I labeled F-actin-binding activity .
237						When human neutrophils were subjected to SDS-PAGE , followed either by Western blot analysis using the antibody specific to l-afadin or by 125 I labeled F-actin blot overlay , an immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of ~ 200 kD was detected , and this band showed the 125 I labeled F-actin-binding activity ( data not shown ) .
238						This protein band is likely to be l-afadin , although its molecular mass was slightly smaller than that of rat l-afadin .
239						The different molecular mass values may result from the species ' differences .
240						The exact relationship between the 205-kD protein described by Luna 's group and l-afadin is not known , since the primary structure of the 205-kD protein has not been determined , but the 205-kD protein may be l-afadin .
241						l-Afadin showed 125 I labeled F-actin-binding activity .
242						Neither s-afadin nor the deletion mutant of l-afadin lacking the COOH-terminal 156 aa ( myc-l-afadinDeltaC ) showed this activity , whereas GST-l-afadin-C corresponding to the COOH-terminal 199 aa showed the 125 I labeled F-actin- binding activity .
243						The Mono Q sample of l-afadin increased the viscosity of F-actin on the low shear viscometry .
244						Furthermore , His6-l-afadin-C corresponding to the COOH-terminal 199 aa was cosedimented with F-actin .
245						These results indicate that l-afadin shows F-actin-binding activity and that the domain responsible for this activity is located at the COOH-terminal 199 aa .
246						Many actin binding protein families have been isolated and characterized .
247						Of these families , for instance , the alpha-actinin and spectrin family members have been shown to usually form oligomers , such as a homodimer or a heterotetramer , and thereby show the F-actin-cross-linking activity .
248						alpha-Actinin made the viscosity of F-actin unmeasurably high on the low shear viscometry , and it caused F-actin to associate into bundles and meshworks , as estimated by transmission electron microscopy .
249						The stoichiometry is one alpha-actinin molecule per about seven actin molecules , and the kilodalton value is the order of 10 -7 .
250						In contrast , the effect of the Mono Q sample of l-afadin on F-actin was small on the low shear viscometry , and the sample hardly showed F-actin-cross-linking activity , as estimated by transmission electron microscopy .
251						The stoichiometry was calculated to be 1 His6-l-afadin-C molecule per ~ 500 actin molecules .
252						The kilodalton value was calculated to be the order of 10 -7 .
253						These results indicate that l-afadin belongs to a family different from the alpha-actinin and spectrin family .
254						The ERM family , including ezrin , radixin , and moesin , belongs to the band 4.1 superfamily , an F-actin-binding protein superfamily , and there have been several reports that purified ezrin and moesin are hardly cosedimented with F-actin .
255						Luna 's group has recently shown by the 125 I labeled F-actin blot overlay that ezrin and moesin exhibit the F-actin-binding activity .
256						They have also shown by competition experiments using the 125 I labeled F-actin blot overlay that ezrin and moesin bind along the sides of F-actin .
257						The biochemical properties of l-afadin are apparently similar to those of ezrin and moesin .
258						l-Afadin may bind F-actin in a manner similar to those of ezrin and moesin .
259						An immunofluorescence microscopic study by use of the antibody specific to l-afadin revealed that l-afadin was localized at the junctional complex region .
260						Further microscopic and electron microscopic studies revealed that l-afadin was concentrated at cadherin based cell-to-cell AJ .
261						Taken together with the biochemical properties of l-afadin , l-afadin is likely to be involved in the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and cell-to-cell AJ .
262						Both l- and s-afadins have one PDZ domain .
263						The PDZ domain has been found in a variety of proteins that are typically localized at cell-to-cell junctions and shown to bind to the unique COOH-terminal motifs of target proteins , which are found in a large number of transmembrane proteins .
264						l-Afadin may be recruited to cell-to-cell AJ through its PDZ domain .
265						To understand the mechanism by which l-afadin is localized at cell-to-cell AJ , it is of crucial importance to identify its interacting molecule ( s ) .
266						Many F-actin-binding proteins , including alpha-actinin , talin , and vinculin , have been shown to serve as linkers between the actin cytoskeleton and integrin at cell-to-matrix AJ .
267						The cytoplasmic domain of the beta-subunit of integrin interacts directly with alpha-actinin and talin and indirectly with vinculin through alpha-actinin and talin .
268						At cell-to-cell AJ , the cytoplasmic domain of cadherin interacts with alpha-catenin through beta-catenin .
269						alpha-Catenin interacts directly with F-actin , alpha-actinin , and ZO-1 .
270						Vinculin is highly concentrated at cell-to-cell AJ , but its interacting molecule has not yet been identified .
271						We showed here that l-afadin was localized at cell-to-cell AJ .
272						Therefore , the molecular linkage mechanism between the actin cytoskeleton and cadherin is apparently similar to that between the actin cytoskeleton and integrin in the sense that F-actin is linked to each transmembrane protein through multiple F-actin-binding proteins .
273						The AF-6 gene has originally been identified as a fusion partner of the ALL-1 gene , which is known to be involved in acute leukemia .
274						It has recently been shown that the AF-6 gene maps outside the minimal region of deletion in ovarian cancers with similar chromosomal aberrations .
275						However , neither the significance of the fusion of these two genes nor the role of s-afadin in carcinogenesis has been clarified .
276						s-Afadin has recently been shown to have significant homology to the product of the Drosophila canoe gene ( Miyamato et al. , 1995 ) .
277						The canoe gene interacts genetically with the Notch signal cascade in the eye , bristle , and wing development ( Miyamato et al. , 1995 ) .
278						Moreover , the canoe gene interacts genetically with the armadillo ( beta-catenin ) gene ( Miyamato et al. , 1995 ) .
279						The products of the Notch and armadillo genes have been implicated in adhesive cell-to-cell communications .
280						l- and s-Afadins may also play a role in the development of various tissues by mediating interactions between the adhesive molecule initiated signal transduction pathways .
281						The AF-6 protein ( s-afadin ) has recently been shown to interact specifically with the GTP bound active form of Ras small G protein ; however , we have not been able to reproduce this earlier finding .
282						We found that both the GDP- and GTP bound forms of Ki-Ras interacted with l- and s-afadins to similar extents and that the stoichiometry of these interactions was negligible ( data not shown ) .
283						Moreover , an immunofluorescence microscopic study of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing an myc tagged dominant active mutant of Ki-Ras ( N12V ) or an myc tagged wild type of Ki-Ras showed that these two types of Ras are not concentrated at cell-to-cell AJ ( Takaishi , K. , and Y. Takai , unpublished observations ) .
284						All of these results do not support the specific interaction of Ras with s-afadin , and the relationship between Ras and s-afadin is currently unknown .
