10						introduction
11						Rab gtpase be use to encode information about the state of a membrane or membrane domain in order to control specific membrane trafficking event .
12						rab be activate by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( gef ) promote the release of GDP and binding of gtp .
13						"accord to the prevail model , gef together with other regulatory factor localize to and act at specific membrane surface , and thus provide a means to locally activate they target rab ."
14						"this system allow vesicle derive from a particular organelle to be tag with a specific Rab gtpase , and they movement along the cytoskeleton and tethering to a specified domain on a target membrane to be control ."
15						effector protein complex that be either activate or recruit to the membrane surface by the presence of the gtp bind Rab mediate these cytoskeletal and membrane tethering function .
16						gtp hydrolysis trigger either by additional gtpase activate protein ( gap ) or spontaneously because of intrinsic activity of the Rab end the cycle .
17						gef and gap therefore play a key role in the specific activation and inactivation of Rab gtpase .
18						the known Rab gef and gap typically fall into discrete family define by conserve protein domain .
19			e29	s2	Rab gap characteristically contain a tbc domain that catalyze nucleotide hydrolysis by a arginine-glutamine two-finger mechanism .	"with the exception of the rab3gap1 and 2 protein , Rab gap characteristically contain a tbc domain that catalyze nucleotide hydrolysis by a arginine-glutamine two-finger mechanism ."
20	taxonomy:9606	human	"s2,e290"	s2	"in human , the tbc domain family have over 40 member , and it be likely that these regulate all 63 human rab , with some tbc domain protein act on several closely related rab ."	"in human , the tbc domain family have over 40 member , and it be likely that these regulate all 63 human rab , with some tbc domain protein act on several closely related rab ."
21						"Rab gef be more diverse , and several conserve , yet structurally unrelated protein and protein complex have be show to have specific Rab gef activity ."
22	taxonomy:7215	drosophila	"e30,e32,e33,e34,e35,e36,s3"	"s2,s3"	"the TRAPP and I complex activate ypt1p and rab1 , vps9 domain protein activate rab5 and ypt51p subfamily gtpase , sec2p and rabin protein activate sec4p gtpase , the ric1p and rgp1p complex activate ypt6p and possibly rab6 , the mon1p and ccz1p complex act on ypt7p and rab7 | the rcc1 domain protein claret , which may act as a gef for the unique rab lightoid in drosophila ."	"these be : the TRAPP and I complex activate ypt1p and rab1 , vps9 domain protein activate rab5 and ypt51p subfamily gtpase , sec2p and rabin protein activate sec4p gtpase , the ric1p and rgp1p complex activate ypt6p and possibly rab6 , the mon1p and ccz1p complex act on ypt7p and rab7 , and the rcc1 domain protein claret , which may act as a gef for the unique rab lightoid in drosophila ."
23						"apart from claret , these gef and they target Rab gtpase act in trafficking pathway conserve from mammal to yeast ."
24						"however , mammalian cell possess > 60 rab , compare with the 11 of bud yeast , and therefore require additional gef to activate these extra rab ."
25						"at present , most of the 60 mammalian rab lack a defined gef activity , and it be therefore unclear how they would be specifically activate ."
26						additional rab gef be therefore likely to exist .
27						denn domain protein be first implicate as Rab gef by the biochemical purification of a rab3 gef from bovine brain .
28						"this be subsequently identify as a denn domain protein , although it remain unclear which domain in the protein be responsible for gef activity ."
29	"taxonomy:6239"	"caenorhabditis elegan"	"s4,e37,e38"	"s4"	MADD homologue aex-3 be responsible for control the activity of rab3 and rab27	further study reveal that the caenorhabditis elegan MADD homologue aex-3 be responsible for control the activity of rab3 and rab27 at the synapse .
30						"more recently , a screen for defective receptor mediate yolk protein endocytosis in C. elegan identify another denn domain protein rme-4 , and indicate that it act on rab35 ."
31						this be confirm by complementary study in mammalian cell show that the rme-4 homologue dennd1a and connecdenn be in fact a rab35 gef .
32						these finding support the idea that denn domain protein might form a family of Rab gef .
33						"to investigate this , we have characterize the human denn domain protein , and identify they target or substrate rab gtpase ."
34						result
35						identification of human denn domain protein
36						sequence search of the human genome use the denn domain of the rab3 gef MADD reveal the presence of 17 protein share this domain .
37						"all these protein carry a full denn domain comprise the three upstream ( u-denn ) , core ( DENN ) , and downstream ( d-denn ) subregion ."
38						"systematic search of the genome sequence database reveal that although widely conserve in metazoan and protozoan , these DENN domain protein be absent from the bud yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae use as a model for trafficking study ."
39	taxonomy:9606	humans	"e40,s6"	s6	denn domain protein may act as gef for some of the many additional rab	this suggest that denn domain protein may act as gef for some of the many additional rab find in human and other metazoan .
40						"further analysis indicate that in addition to these protein , there be a group of related protein contain partial denn homology ."
41						some of these such as avl9 and its homologue be conserve to bud yeast and other fungus .
42						"because avl9 may be a gef for the non Rab ra family gtpase gtr2 in late golgus trafficking , these be unlikely to be Rab gef and they be not pursue further in this study ."
43						Figure 1 .

58						DENND1B-S specifically promote gtp binding to rab35 but not the other rab test .
59						similar result be obtain for dennd1a and the long form of dennd1b .
60						dennd1c in contrast be most active toward rab13 and show no activity to rab35 .
61			"e47,e48"	s6	dennd1a and dennd1b be rab35 specific gef 	"together , these finding show that dennd1a and dennd1b be rab35 specific gef , and that this activity be cause by the denn domain ."

210						discussion
211						denn form a conserved family of Rab gef
212						the result present here provide good evidence that denn protein form a family of highly specific Rab GEF regulator control specific intracellular transport pathway .
213						"denn protein be conserve in primitive unicellular eukaryote such as protozoan of the Naegleria genus , fission yeast , filamentous fungus , and plant ; however , they be absent from bud yeast ."
214						"consistent with this , none of the DENN target rab identify by this study be present in bud yeast ."
215						"as report previously , MADD act on rab27a , which function in melanosome transport ."
216	taxonomy:6239	c. elegans	"s8,e64"	s8	 rme-4 act on rab35	dennd1 and the C. elegan equivalent rme-4 act on rab35 in endocytic trafficking pathway absent from bud yeast .
217						previous investigation of the dennd1 and connecdenn protein in human cell have show that rab35 and dennd1a and connecdenn 1 play a role in recycling of mhc class i at a early endosomal compartment .
218						"these author have also show that connecdenn protein interact with clathrin , and we finding confirm this for dennd1a and connecdenn 1 ."
219						"we find that clathrin be require for shiga toxin delivery to the TGN , but not its endocytosis ."
220						"this fit with the idea that the stxb traffic through a early endosomal sorting compartment , where it undergo a clathrin dependent sort event , before delivery to the TGN ."
221						"dennd3 and dennd1c , like they target rab12 and rab13 , respectively , be present in vertebrate but be absent in invertebrate ."
222						"in mammalian polarize epithelial cell , rab13 function in trafficking between recycle endosome and the TGN ."
223						"together with the datum present here , this suggest that the dennd1 family control endosomal recycling and endosome-tgn trafficking route involve rab13 and rab35 ."
224						"putative orthologue of dennd5a and rab6-interacting protein 1 and its target rab39 exist in worm , fly , and vertebrate ."
225						"interestingly , rab39 be localized to the golgus apparatus like its regulator dennd5a and b , and loss-of-function mutation in rab39b cause x link mental retardation ."
226						"the underlie defect appear to be cause by altered trafficking require for growth cone and synapse formation , which suggest that further study of dennd5 should focus on neuronal system rather than fibroblast like tissue culture cell ."
227						"a homologue of the Myotubularin phosphatase domain contain denn protein mtmr5 and mtmr13 , and they target rab28 , be present in protozoan , which suggest this have a trafficking function conserve at the cellular level rather than in a tissue specific pathway ."
228						"contradict this view somewhat , mutation in human mtmr13 and disruption of mmr13 in mouse result in a autosomal recessive neuropathy , which suggest a function important for nervous system function ."
229						"finally , dennd4 family gef and rab10 be also always find together in multicellular organism with polarize epithelial cell layer ."
230						rab of the rab8 and rab10 family have be implicate in trafficking to polarize membrane domain at the cell surface .
231						"in bud yeast sec4p , the rab8 homologue be require for polarize transport from the late-golgus into the grow bud ."
232						"in higher eukaryote , rab8 have be find to function in transport to actin rich membrane protrusion , the cilium , and apical surface of polarize epithelial cell ."
233						"in contrast , rab10 be report to function in basolateral transport ."
234						"it seem obvious that rab8 and rab10 would require activation by specific gef , and this appear to be the case ."
235						"sec4p and rab8 be activate by sec2 domain gef , whereas dennd4 family gef activate rab10 ."
236						"this be support by observation that mutation in CRAG , the presumed drosophilum orthologue of human dennd4 , result in missorting of cargo such as perlecan and laminin destine for the basolateral surface of cell ."
237						"however , the fruit fly pose a problem for this simple idea because it lack a documented gene encode a sec2 domain protein ."
238						"at present , it be only possible to speculate how rab8 be activate in fruit fly , but the two most likely possibility be either that there be a novel rab8 gef or that a known gef family have acquire activity toward rab8 ."
239						"dennd2 specificity raise similar issue because rab9 be present in fly , although a readily discernable dennd2 be not ."
240						"fly may have some unique feature with regard to Rab regulation , and further study will be necessary to address these issue ."
241						"interestingly , dennd2b , also know as suppressor of tumorigenicity 5 ( st5 ) , be mutate in human patient suffer from mental retardation and multiple congenital abnormality that can result in deafness , cleft palate , and circulatory and kidney function defect ."
242						"we result suggest that these defect may be cause by defective regulation of rab9 , and hence trafficking between late endosome and lysosome ."
243						"this be reminiscent of lysosomal storage disorder , which be long know to cause mental retardation and other developmental abnormality ."
244						there appear to be no obvious characteristic distinguish DENN modulate rab from those control by other class of gef and rab with as yet unknown gef .
245						in a sequence alignment partition into these three group there be no position that clearly differentiate rab under DENN regulation from other ( unpublished datum ) .
246						"furthermore , when sequence conservation among DENN modulate Rabs be map onto the surface of the structure of one of they , no additional conserve surface patch -- putative denn-interaction site -- be observe when a comparison be make to Rabs not under DENN control ( unpublished datum ) ."
247						"this suggest that denn bind to site that overlap those see for other gef , perhaps because of shared functional necessity such as switch i displacement ."
248						this and a apparent lack of signature feature of DENN modulate rab suggest that only small change and and or change at different position may have be responsible for alter GEF class specificity during Rab evolution .
249						this conclusion be support by the close relationship between rab that be regulate by unrelated gef class .
250						be denn related protein Rab gef ?
251						"as show here and elsewhere , denn domain protein be specific Rab gef ."
252						"it be interesting to note that some of the DENN related protein be find throughout the eukaryotic kingdom and be therefore likely to function in conserve cellular process , include membrane trafficking event ."
253						this suggest that the DENN related protein might also have Rab GEF activity .
254						"however , the only characterize member of this family , bud yeast avl9p , be possibly a regulator of gtr2p , a ra superfamily gtpase outside the Rab subfamily ."
255						we preliminary evidence also indicate that human avl9 do not act on any of the human rab .
256						"although this support the idea that DENN and DENN related domain specify gef activity toward gtpase of the ra superfamily , these finding suggest they may not all be Rab gef ."
257						further study will be need to investigate they specificity and define the cellular process they act in .
258						many conserve rab lack gef regulator
259						"despite the advance present here in assign the specificity of 17 rab gef , several key rab involve in membrane trafficking , lipid droplet , and cilium formation be still leave without gef activator ."
260						it be intriguing that these often cluster into related group .
261						"for example , see rab2/4/14 in , which may indicate that these share a family of related but as yet unknown regulator ."
262						"here , we argue that because Rabs form a large closely related family , they regulator might do the same and share a common domain ."
263						this lead we to more closely investigate the denn domain protein .
264						"follow this line of argument , it may therefore be worthwhile to test conserve domain widely associate with protein function in trafficking for gef activity ."
265						"this might include the DENN related protein , although there be caveat as discuss , the SNX and bar domain family , and rcc1 domain protein ."
266						"however , it be possible that common domain do not unite the remain Rab gef , and thus other unbiased biochemical and genetic strategy will need to be follow if they be to be identify ."
267						"although the work present here will be useful in inform many future study on membrane trafficking , we be still some way from define the full complement of Rab GEF and GAP regulator and effector protein necessary for a full understanding of rab function ."
