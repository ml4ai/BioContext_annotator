15						introduction
16						ra signaling lead to proliferation and cell survival and be activate in many cancer .
17						"aberrant function of the ra pathway be very common in breast cancer ( review in , ) ."
18						"introduction of activate ra ( v12 ) into most immortalize cell line , include the immortalized mcf10a human mammary epithelial cell ( hmec ) line , lead to transformation ."
19						"however , when ra ( v12 ) be express in primary cell , these cell senesce instead of undergo transformation ."
20						this oncogene induce senescence ( oi ) display by primary cell represent a tumor suppressive mechanism inherent in these cell .
21						Research be ongoing to determine the protein and pathway involve in ra transformation and ra induce senescence .
22						"it be important to determine the different molecular player necessary for ra transformation versus ra induce senescence , as these could be critical target for cancer therapy ."

27						c and ebpbeta3 begin at the last in-frame atg at amino acid 198 and have a apparent molecular weight of 20kda .
28						"c and ebpbeta1 and c and ebpbeta2 both contain the c-terminal dna binding and dimerization domain and a n-terminal transactivation domain , allow they to function as transcriptional activator ."
29						c and ebpbeta3 lack the n-terminal transactivation domain and thus repress transcription .
30						the c and ebpbeta knockout mouse demonstrate that c and ebpbeta be essential for proper development of the mammary gland .
31						these mouse display a dual phenotype : a defect in MEC proliferation and differentiation .
32						the production of multiple isoform of c and ebpbeta may explain how a single transcription factor can regulate both differentiation and proliferation .
33						the functional difference between the transactivator isoform of c and ebpbeta have not be study in great detail .
34						c and ebpbeta1 be oftentimes mistake for the 48 kda ( top band ) of the c and ebpbeta2 doublet on immunoblot largely because c and ebpbeta1 be not express in transform cell line ( see below ) .
35						"because of this difficulty in decipher between c and ebpbeta1 and -2 and because both isoform be transcriptional activator , many consider they to be functionally redundant ."

156	uaz:UA-CLine-6278	mcf10a	c31			therefore we treat the mcf10a-ras-c and ebpbeta1 cell with a panel of kinase inhibitor to determine if inhibit phosphorylation could stabilize p52-c and ebpbeta1 expression .

166						"although introduction of ra ( v12 ) into many immortalize cell line lead to transformation , introduction of ra ( v12 ) into primary cell have a different effect ."
167						"normal fibroblast , such as wi-38 hdf , undergo senescence when force to express oncogene such as activate ra ( v12 ) or raf ( e600 ) ."
168						"demonstrate that c and ebpbeta be necessary for ra ( v12 ) - induce senescence in mef , which occur in a prb dependent manner ."
169						recently have show that c and ebpbeta be require for activate raf ( e600 ) - induce senescence in hdf .
170						"in the present study we set out to determine which transactivator isoform of c and ebpbeta be responsible for OIS , as there be increase evidence for functional difference between the transactivator isoform ( , , , Kowentz-Leutz and Leutz , 1999 ) ."

176						c and ebpbeta2 can induce senescence to a lesser extent .
177						it be interesting that c and ebpbeta2 expression in wi-38 fibroblast do induce senescence .
178	uaz:UA-CLine-888	wi-38 cells	c35			"because c and ebpbeta1 be express in the wi-38 cell , we can not rule out that c and ebpbeta2 be heterodimerize with the endogenous c and ebpbeta1 to induce il6 and thus senescence , albeit at a lower level ."

180			e67	c35	c and ebpbeta1 to induce il6	"take together , it be likely that ra ( v12 ) / raf ( e600 ) be work through c and ebpbeta1 to induce il6 and lead to senescence in normal cell ."
181						we propose that degradation of c and ebpbeta1 by ra ( v12 ) may be a mechanism by which cell bypass oi .
182						loss of expression of full length c and ebpbeta1 may be necessary for escape from senescence and a step closer to transformation .
183						further support of this lie in the expression profile of c and ebpbeta1 in normal versus transform cell .
184						"c and ebpbeta1 be present in normal cell , and be not degrade when ra ( v12 ) be introduce and induce senescence in normal cell ."
185	uaz:UA-CLine-100076	MCF10As	"e68,c36"	c36	c and ebpbeta be negatively regulate by ra during ra ( v12 ) transformation of mcf10a .	"additionally , this first isoform of c and ebpbeta be negatively regulate by ra during ra ( v12 ) transformation of mcf10a ."
186						p52-C and ebpbeta1 expression be not observe in breast cancer cell in which the ra pathway be activate .
187						the expression pattern of c and ebpbeta1 in normal versus transform cell support we current finding that c and ebpbeta1 play a important role in senescence and be negatively regulate during transformation .
188						"it be not surprising that a protein that play a critical role in OIS , a tumor suppressive mechanism , be down regulate during transformation ."
189			e69	c36	inhibit cdk2 with roscovitine stabilize expression of c and ebpbeta1	"moreover , recently it have be show that cdk2 suppress cellular senescence , consistent with we finding that inhibit cdk2 with roscovitine stabilize expression of c and ebpbeta1 , a factor involve in senescence ( Campaner et al. , hydbr et al. ) ."
190						"in further support of we finding , use a c and ebpbeta construct in which the start site for c and ebpbeta2 and -3 be mutate such that only c and ebpbeta1 could be translate ."
191						"they demonstrate that expression of this construct in hdf lead to cell cycle arrest and induction of il6 , consistent with we result ."
192						the production of multiple isoform of c and ebpbeta be a possible explanation for which this transcription factor could regulate the functional difference observe upon expression of ra ( v12 ) .
193						we datum indicate that c and ebpbeta1 be the isoform responsible for mediate ra ( v12 ) - induce senescence .
194						"in contrast to c and ebpbeta1 , c and ebpbeta2 expression be not negatively regulate in mcf10a cell upon ra ( v12 ) - induce transformation ."
195						"additionally , overexpression of c and ebpbeta2 in mcf10a lead to the acquisition of tumorigenic characteristic , similarly to ra ( v12 ) expression in these cell ."
196						"therefore , ra may be signal to this second isoform of c and ebpbeta during transformation ."
197						"unfortunately it be not possible to knockdown each specific isoform of c and ebpbeta via siRNA technology and determine the role each isoform be play , because all three isoform be translate from a single mrna molecule ."
198						"importantly , one study have examine the specific role of c and ebpbeta2 in activate macrophage by generate a knock-in mouse in which the second in-frame methionine necessary for translation of c and ebpbeta2 be replace with a alanine ."
199						this abolish expression of c and ebpbeta2 in these mouse .
200			e70	c37	" induction of c and ebpbeta target gene , such as il6"	"the induction of c and ebpbeta target gene , such as il6 , be examine in this study ."
201	uaz:UA-CLine-100087	HDFs	c37			"activate macrophage in the mouse unable to express c and ebpbeta2 be still able to induce il6 expression , consistent with we current finding that c and ebpbeta2 be not the primary isoform responsible for induction of il6 in hdf ."
202						"c and ebpbeta play many functional role in the cell , even role that seem conflict such as cell survival , cell death , proliferation , senescence , and transformation ."
203						this may be explain in part by the presence of the different isoform of c and ebpbeta and they functional difference .
204						future study on c and ebpbeta will need to take into consideration that the different isoform of this transcription factor be likely playing functionally distinct role .
205						degradation of c and ebpbeta1 by ra ( v12 ) may be a mechanism by which cell bypass oi .
206						"we study shed light on how ra signaling be alter in ra ( v12 ) - induce senescence versus transformation through the regulation of c and ebpbeta1 , however further investigation of what dictate this transition be necessary to more completely understand this critical switch ."
207						it will be important to determine the detail of the signaling between ra and c and ebpbeta in normal cell to elucidate mechanism by which this critical signaling that induce OIS can be trigger or maintain to suppress tumorigenesis .
