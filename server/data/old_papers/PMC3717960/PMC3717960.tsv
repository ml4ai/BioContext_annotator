1						up regulation of c-myc and sirt1 expression correlate with malignant transformation in the serrated route to colorectal cancer
2						approximately 7.5 % of all colorectal cancer be consider to originate from the alternative , serrated route .
3						here , we investigate the expression of the c-myc oncogene and the sirt1 protein deacetylase by immunohistochemical staining in subgroup of colorectal serrated lesion that be characterize by different molecular alteration .
4						the expression of c-myc and sirt1 correlate with the presence of KRAS and BRAF mutation and high expression of c-myc and sirt1 be strongly associate with higher grade of malignancy .
5						in contrast , in the majority of serrated lesion without KRAS or BRAF mutation , c-myc and sirt1 expression be not find increase .
6						in this group only a subset of mostly high grade intraepithelial neoplasium and carcinoma be characterize by elevated c-myc and sirt1 expression .
7						this be associate with nuclear localization of beta-catenin , indicate that wnt pathway activation may confer transcriptional induction of c-myc .
8						in summary , we establish a link between oncogenic k-ra and b-raf , suggest post-transcriptional regulation of c-myc through mapk/erk1/2 pathway activation , as well as for wnt signalling to the activation of the c-myc oncogene , and consequently of sirt1 in the serrated route .
9						the increase expression with higher grade of malignancy suggest crucial function for c-myc and sirt1 in the progression of serrated lesion to colorectal cancer .
10						these function may include antagonize of apoptosis and senescence , which be characteristic feature of serrated lesion .

80						nuclear beta-catenin expression in serrated lesion
81						to elucidate whether activation of the wnt pathway may be involve in c-myc over-expression , all serrated lesion , with and without KRAS or BRAF mutation be analyze for nuclear beta-catenin expression .
82						as document by the lack of nuclear beta-catenin expression there be no sign of activate wnt signalling in all sessile serrated adenoma and hyperplastic polyp , except for some cell at the base of the crypt .
83						nuclear beta-catenin be only find in one sessile serrated adenoma with low grade intraepithelial neoplasium out of 25 ( 4 % ) lesion with low grade intraepithelial neoplasium .
84						in lesion with high grade intraepithelial neoplasium nuclear beta-catenin be detect in seven out of 17 case ( 41 % ) comprise three sessile serrated adenoma with high grade intraepithelial neoplasium , and four traditional serrated adenoma with high grade intraepithelial neoplasium .
85						in invasive carcinoma nuclear beta-catenin be find in 14 out of 25 case ( 51 % ) , whereby this be not associate with morphological change .
86						therefore , nuclear beta-catenin expression do not correlate with any morphological subtype of serrated lesion .
87						nuclear beta-catenin in relation to the braf and KRAS mutational status , c-myc and sirt1 expression
88						nuclear beta-catenin expression occur in all three category of lesion , with increase prevalence with higher grade of malignancy .
89						however , the percentage of case positive for nuclear beta-catenin differ strongly depend on the braf and KRAS mutational status : compare to 38 % in the braf and KRAS wild type group , and 27 % in the mutant KRAS group , nuclear beta-catenin be notably lower in lesion with braf mutation ( 8 % ) .
90						interestingly , high grade intraepithelial lesion with wild type braf and kra reveal a marked predominance of nuclear beta-catenin ( 80 % versus 27 % in the braf and KRAS mutant case ) .
91						in lesion with braf or kra mutation , high c-myc and sirt1 expression be independent of nuclear beta-catenin expression as the expression level do not differ between beta-catenin positive and negative case .
92						for instance in some lesion with high grade intraepithelial neoplasium and kra mutation that display high c-myc and sirt1 expression , no nuclear beta-catenin be detect , whereas other lesion with equally high c-myc and sirt1 level be positive for nuclear beta-catenin ( datum not show ) .
93						in the majority of case with kra or braf mutation , high c-myc expression be consistently observe in lesion with low grade intraepithelial neoplasium to invasive carcinoma ( summarize in Figure ) .
94						this do not correlate with nuclear beta-catenin , which be only detect in higher grade lesion .
95						interestingly , in wild type braf and kra lesion with high grade intraepithelial neoplasium , moderate to strong c-myc expression correlate with nuclear beta-catenin localization .
96						in wild type KRAS and BRAF invasive adenocarcinoma with nuclear beta-catenin , increase c-myc expression be associate with a up regulation of sirt1 .
97						conversely , invasive adenocarcinoma negative for nuclear beta-catenin do not reveal any substantial c-myc and sirt1 staining ( datum not show ) .
98						thus , transcriptional activation through the beta-catenin and tcf complex may result in increase c-myc , and consequently elevated sirt1 protein level in serrated lesion without constitutive k-ra or b-raf activation .
99						generally , however the molecular difference between the invasive serrated carcinoma be not associate with any overt morphological alteration .

109						discussion
110						the evolve concept of serrated lesion of the colon comprise the notion of a sessile and traditional serrated pathway .
111						sessile serrated adenoma be more frequently find in the proximal colon , initiate through braf mutation and be commonly MSI .
112						in contrast , traditional serrated adenoma be more often find in the distal colon , harbour KRAS mutation and be msi-l or mss .
113						in we collection the distribution and mutation status of case reflect this concept .
114						but despite the clear preference of location and mutation status of serrated lesion , c-myc and sirt1 expression be unrelated to the morphologic subtype and side distribution .
115						a characteristic feature of serrated lesion of the colon be the resistance to apoptosis that have be link to mutational activation of KRAS and BRAF [ , - ] .
116						however , the molecular event downstream of oncogenic kra and braf responsible for the anti-apoptotic function in serrated lesion have not be completely define .

123						in lesion and invasive carcinoma of the serrated route , high c-myc and sirt1 level be associate with k-ra , b-raf , or in a minor fraction , with wnt pathway activation .

142						future study will reveal the relevance of the effect in this novel crosstalk of the epigenetic regulator dnmt1 and the histone deacetylase sirt1 in different cellular context and especially in serrated lesion of the colon .
143						interestingly , recent study reveal that in chronic myelogenous leukemia ( cml ) sirt1 inhibition can prevent the acquisition of mutation and may therefore represent a treatment to overcome drug resistance .
144						in addition , in a bcr-abl transgenic mouse model inhibition of sirt1 in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib lead to p53 activation mediate elimination of cancer stem cell , indicate that sirt1 inhibition may represent a strategy for target cancer stem cell .
145						take together , we provide evidence that c-myc and sirt1 be crucially involve in the alternative , serrated pathway to colorectal cancer .
146						thereby , oncogenic function of c-myc and property of sirt1 , such as antagonize apoptosis and senescence and and or epigentic regulation may contribute to tumorigenesis and may represent a novel target for future therapy .
147						however , further study will have to elucidate the exact functional role of sirt1 in serrated lesion and determine the signalling pathway involve in the development of lesion without oncogenic braf or kra mutation .

168						aec+ high sensitivity substrate chromogen ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) be use as a chromogen for sirt1 , dab+ substrate chromogen system ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) for c-myc and beta-catenin .
169						all slide be counterstain with hematoxylin ( Vector Laboratories , CA , USA ) .
170						to confirm staining specificity , system control without primary antibody , as well as immunoglobulin isotype control antibody be include .
171						evaluation of c-myc , sirt1 and beta-catenin staining
172						c-MYC and sirt1 expression be evaluate regard nuclear expression pattern range from 0 - 3 , for negative , low , moderate and strong staining .
173						in hyperplastic polyp and sessile serrated adenoma , positive staining of the basal third of the crypt be define as low .
174						moderate be define as staining of the basal two third of the crypt , and strong be define as staining from the base to the surface of the crypt .
175						in sessile serrated adenoma with low grade and high grade intraepithelial neoplasium , only area with intraepithelial neoplasium be take into account .
176						in traditional serrated adenoma and invasive adenocarcinoma , the percentage of positive cell be evaluate include negative ( 0 % ) , low ( 1-30 % ) , moderate ( 31-70 % ) and strong ( 71-100 % ) expression .
177						regard beta-catenin staining , only nuclear beta-catenin expression be take into account .
178						beta-catenin , c-myc and sirt1 staining that be confine to some nucleus of scatter cell at the basis of crypt ( < 5 % positive cell ) be consider as a normal mucosa staining pattern , which be consistent with the proliferative zone due to physiologically active wnt signalling within the progenitor population of intestinal epithelium .
179						analysis of KRAS - / braf mutation
180						for the analysis of KRAS exon 2 codon 12 and 13 and braf ( v600e ) exon 15 mutation , genomic dna be extract from microdissect serrated lesion , as previously describe for KRAS .
181						pyro sequencing be do use the Pyro-Gold kit ( Qiagen , Germany ) and HotStar Taq-Polymerase ( Qiagen , Germany ) .
182						the pf2 primer be use to determine anti-sense sequence .
183						the PyroMark q24 device ( Qiagen , Germany ) and the PyroMark ( tm ) q24 software be use for sequencing , and sequence analysis .
184						Supplementary Tables
