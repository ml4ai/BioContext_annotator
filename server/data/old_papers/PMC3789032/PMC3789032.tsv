80						discussion
81						in the present study , several gene be analyze for the first time for possible mutation in thyroid cancer .
82	tissuelist:TS-1047	tyroid	e6,t1	t1	gna11 mutation be analyze in all type of thyroid cancer ( ptc , FTC and ATC ) as they have be frequently identify in uveal melanoma and be know to activate the mapk signaling pathway	gna11 mutation be analyze in all type of thyroid cancer ( ptc , FTC and ATC ) as they have be frequently identify in uveal melanoma and be know to activate the mapk signaling pathway , which be one of the most deregulate signaling pathway in thyroid cancer .
83						however , no mutation be detect in and around codon 209 and 183 .
84						these two hot spot codon be selectively analyze as gna11 mutation have consistently be identify only in these two residue .
85						the mmp be proteolytic enzyme that degrade the component of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane , which be associate with cancer metastasis ( , - ) .
86						atc be the most aggressive type of thyroid cancer that be often associate with deadly metastasis .
87						therefore atc be particularly analyze for the mutation of the mmp27 gene .
88						two mmp have be report to occasionally be mutate in melanoma .
89						the mmp27 gene be analyze for mutation in atc in the present study as we have already previously analyze the second gene , mmp8 , in thyroid cancer .
90						three uncommon mutation be identify ; c351t result in n117n , c1089t result in s363 and g1227a result in g409g silent mutation .
91						the silent mutation be unlikely to be involve in thyroid carcinogenesis as these mutation do not change the basic amino acid .
92	tissuelist:TS-1226	thyroid cancer cells	e7,c3	c3	 fgd1 be normally maintain , hypomethylate and overexpress by braf	we previously reveal that fgd1 be normally maintain , hypomethylate and overexpress by braf ( v600e ) in thyroid cancer cell and in turn observe that it be hyper-methylate after shrna mediate knockdown of braf ( v600e ) in thyroid cancer cell line .
93						base on these finding and the high transforming and invasive potential of the fgd1 gene , we consider there to be a high possibility of identify oncogenic mutation in fgd1 .
94						all 18 exon of the gene be sequence to be analyze for mutation , but only two silent mutation ( t697t and p712p ) be detect .
95						these mutation be unlikely to have a significant role in PTC .
96						no somatic missense mutation be identify in the fgd1 gene .
97						the trrap gene have be report to be mutate in a particular codon , s722f .
98			e8	t2	grm3 activate the mapk signaling pathway	as grm3 activate the mapk signaling pathway , the present study investigate whether grm3 be mutate in ptc sample , since the majority of ptc harbor genetic deregulation in the mapk signaling pathway .
99						no mutation be detect in trrap , while two snp ( t441t and g475d ) be identify in the grm3 gene .
100	tissuelist:TS-1226	 thyroid cancer	t2			this suggest that trrap and grm3 may not have important role in the pathogenesis of this type of thyroid cancer .
101						in conclusion , the present finding suggest that genetic alteration in the gna11 , mmp27 , fgd1 , trrap and grm3 gene may not be significant in the tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer .
102	tissuelist:TS-1226	thyroid cancer	e9,t3	t3	egfr , RET and PTC , ALK , RAS , BRAF , PTEN , pik3ca , pik3cb and pdk1 , be commonly genetically altered via mutation or genetic amplification that be able to independently activate the mapk or pi3k and akt pathway	it be not surprising that mutation in these gene be not common in thyroid cancer since a number of the upstream effector involve in cellular transformation , growth and metastasis , include egfr , RET and PTC , ALK , RAS , BRAF , PTEN , pik3ca , pik3cb and pdk1 , be commonly genetically altered via mutation or genetic amplification that be able to independently activate the mapk or pi3k and akt pathway in thyroid cancer .
