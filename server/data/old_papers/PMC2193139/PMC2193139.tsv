1						A Novel B Lymphocyte Associated Adaptor Protein , Bam32 , Regulates Antigen Receptor Signaling Downstream of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase
2						We have identified and characterized a novel src homology 2 ( SH2 ) and pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain containing adaptor protein , designated Bam32 ( for B cell adaptor molecule of 32 kD ) .
3						cDNAs encoding the human and mouse Bam32 coding sequences were isolated and the human bam32 gene was mapped to chromosome 4q25-q27 .
4						Bam32 is expressed by B lymphocytes , but not T lymphocytes or nonhematopoietic cells .

10						Introduction
11	uaz:UA-CLine-100009,uaz:UA-ORG-1085	 B lymphocytes,peripheral lymphoid tissues	c2,t1			The population of B lymphocytes present in peripheral lymphoid tissues is dynamically maintained by processes that balance the continuous output from the bone marrow and proliferation in response to antigens with B cell terminal differentiation and death .
12						The choices between the alternative fates of proliferation , differentiation , and death , are largely determined by intracellular signaling cascades triggered by receptor-ligand interactions .
13						The B cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) is a central regulator of B cell fate .
14						BCR signaling is required for survival and recirculation of naive B cells as well as for antigen specific immune responses .

Ligation of the BCR by antigen can have different outcomes depending on the differentiation stage of the B cell , the molecular form of antigen , and the immunological context of the antigen encounter .
16					These different outcomes can be due to differences in quality or quantity of signals emanating from the BCR itself and and or differential signaling through other key receptors such as CD19 , CD22 , CD40 , CD72 , CD95 , CDw150 , and FcgammaRII .

The BCR signaling cascade ultimately leads to activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NF-AT ) and nuclear factor of kappa binding ( NF-kappaB ) .
24						In at least one case , alternative outcomes of BCR signaling correlate with differential activation of these transcription factors .
25						During B cell responses to thymus dependent antigens , key B cell activation and differentiation events occur within germinal centers ( GCs ) .
26						The GC response is initiated when B cells activated by encounter with antigen and cognate T cell help migrate to the B cell follicles and begin proliferating rapidly in association with the follicular dendritic cell ( FDC ) network to give rise to a GC .
27						GC B cells begin a complex differentiation program that incorporates somatic hypermutation coupled with selection for high-affinity antigen specific Ig , Ig class switching , and differentiation into memory B cells or plasma cells .
28						GC B cells represent a distinct differentiation state and display several unique properties such as a predisposition to apoptosis and reexpression of genes expressed during early B cell development .
29						The molecular basis for B cell activation and differentiation processes occurring within GCs is poorly understood .
30						In this study , we have undertaken a screen for GC associated genes and report the identification and characterization of a novel B cell restricted signaling molecule that is highly expressed in GC B cells and appears to regulate B cell activation pathways downstream of PI3K .
31						Materials and Methods
32						Isolation of the Bam32 cDNA .
33						Enriched FDC populations were obtained from human tonsils according to the method of Liu et al. .
35						Cells ( 10 6 ) were pooled from three preparations , total RNA was isolated , and double stranded cDNA was produced using the switching mechanism at RNA termini ( SMART ) PCR cDNA synthesis method ( Clontech ) .
36						PCR analysis of the resulting cDNA using primers that can distinguish FDC and B cell isoforms of CD21 indicated that both isoforms were present in approximately equal proportions ( data not shown ) .
37						A double stranded driver cDNA was concomitantly produced by the same method using an equal mixture of RNA from the fibroblast cell lines HFF and 122 and the epithelial line HeLa .
38						A suppression subtractive hybridization ( SSH ) PCR subtraction procedure was carried out according to the manufacturer 's protocol ( PCR Select ; Clontech ) , using the FDC cDNA as tester and the fibroblast and epithelial cell cDNA as driver .
39						The pool of differentially expressed gene fragments generated was then cloned into the pCRII vector ( Invitrogen ) , and 60 clones were randomly picked and screened for differential expression using tester and driver cDNA probes .
40						Differentially expressed clones were sequenced by dye-terminator sequencing ( PE Biosystems ) .
41						The Bam32 SSH fragment was used as a probe to screen a human lymph node cDNA library , and several positive clones were obtained and sequenced .
42						A fragment of the murine Bam32 cDNA was obtained by low stringency reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR , and then the entire cDNA was obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) with an adaptor ligated cDNA template derived from Balb and c spleen ( Clontech ) .

52						1 and 10 of the resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification for 30 cycles using Bam32 specific primers TGTCTCACAGAGCGAGAAGGTGTCAGG and GAACCATCAGAGTGCCTGTCTCGCTTCC or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G3PDH ) control primers TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGT and CATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC .
53						The resulting PCR products were run on agarose gels , Southern blotted , and hybridized with oligonucleotide probes : CTCTACCTCTGTGAAGGGCGCGAATG ( Bam32 ) and TGGGCGCCTGGTCACCAGGGCTGCTT ( G3PDH ) .
54						For analysis of Bam32 expression in primary B cell subsets , tonsillar B cells were prepared as described , stained with FITC labeled anti-IgD ( mAb deltaSTA4-1 ) and PE labeled anti-CD38 ( Immunotech ) , and sorted into IgD + CD38 - ( naive ) , IgD - CD38 + ( GC ) , and IgD - CD38 + ( memory ) fractions using a FACStar PLUS ( TM ) instrument ( Becton Dickinson ) .
55						For in vitro stimulation experiments , naive ( high density ) B cells were prepared by Percoll fractionation of tonsillar B cells , as described .
56						Cells were stimulated with 2 mug and ml anti-CD40 ( mAb G28-5 ) and harvested at the indicated time .
57						The indicated dilution of first-strand cDNA was used for PCR amplification as above .

60						Myc tagged Bam32 expression vector was generated by inserting the Bam32 coding sequence into pcDNA3 .1 myc and hisA ( Invitrogen ) in frame with the myc tag .
61						Constructs encoding Bam32 enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) fusion proteins were generated by inserting either sequence encoding the full-length protein ( EGFP-Bam32 ) , amino acids 1-142 ( EGFP-SH2 ) , or amino acids 133-280 ( EGFP-PH ) into the pEGFP-C1 vector ( Clontech ) .
62						R61K , R184C , and K197E point mutants were generated with mutant PCR primers using the splicing by overlap extension ( SOE ) method and inserted into pEGFP-C1 ( PH domain only ) or pcDNA3 ( full-length ) .
63						The Btk PH domain construct contains amino acids 1-195 inserted into pEGFP-C1 .
64						Prokaryotic expression vectors encoding a Bam32 SH2 domain ( amino acids 1-142 ) - glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) fusion protein or a full-length Bam32-GST fusion protein were generated by inserting the appropriate Bam32 coding sequence into the pGEX 5-x-2 vector ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) .
65						Fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) , according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
66						An anti-Bam32 serum ( 4210K ) was generated by immunizing rabbits with a Bam32-GST fusion protein .
67						A Bam32 specific mAb ( UW32 ; IgG1 isotype ) was generated by immunizing mice with Bam32-GST fusion protein , followed by fusion with NS-1 cells and ELISA screening of clones for reactivity against Bam32-GST but not GST alone .

69						Transient Transfection of BJAB Cells .
70						For transient transfection experiments , BJAB cells were resuspended in tissue culture medium at 3 x 10 7 / ml and 400 mul of cells was mixed with the indicated amount of plasmid constructs in a 0.4-cm-gap electroporation cuvette ( Bio-Rad ) and incubated on ice for 10 min .
71						Cells were then electroporated using a Gene Pulser apparatus ( Bio-Rad ) set at 240 V , 960 muF , incubated on ice for a further 10 min , and then transferred to a tissue culture dish containing 20 ml of complete RPMI medium containing 15 % FCS and no antibiotics and incubated overnight in a 37degreesC , 5 % CO 2 incubator .
72						Cells were then harvested , counted , and used in the indicated assays .
73						Immunoprecipitation and Blotting .
74						For stimulation experiments , Ramos cells were resuspended at 2 x 10 7 / ml and stimulated for the indicated periods of time with 10 mug and ml of goat anti-human IgM F ( ab ' ) 2 fragments ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) or 2.5 mM of H 2 O 2 plus 250 muM of sodium orthovanadate ( referred to as pervanadate ) , washed with 10 vol of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1 % sodium azide , and lysed at 4 x 10 7 cells and ml in NP-40 lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 8.0 , 5 mM EDTA , 0.5 % NP-40 , protease inhibitors [ 2 mM PMSF , 10 mug and ml aprotinin , 10 mug and ml leupeptin , and 1 mug and ml pepstatin ] , and phosphatase inhibitors [ 10 mM NaF , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , and 5 mM Na 4 P 2 O 7 ] ) .

79						After 18-20 h , cells were harvested , washed , and rested overnight in low-serum medium ( 1.25 % FCS ) .
80						This manipulation reduced the basal membrane association of the PH domain containing fusion proteins .
81						Cells were then harvested and resuspended at 4-6 x 10 6 / ml in low-serum medium .
82						Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37degreesC with or without PI3K inhibitors wortmannin ( 20 ng and ml ; Calbiochem ) or LY294002 ( 25 muM ; Calbiochem ) , and then stimulated with 10 mug and ml goat anti-human IgM F ( ab ' ) 2 fragments for the indicated time .
83						Cells were then washed in 10 vol of ice-cold PBS , fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde and PBS for 30 min at room temperature , washed twice in PBS , and then mounted on slides using an aqueous mounting solution ( Aqua Polymount ; Polysciences , Inc. ) .
84						EGFP fluorescence was examined using a scanning laser confocal microscope equipped with LaserSharp software ( MRC-1024 system ; Bio-Rad ) .
85						The ratio of membrane to cytoplasmic EGFP fluorescence intensity was determined from digital images using ImageQuant ( R ) software ( Molecular Dynamics ) .

91						After 6 h , the cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured as described .
92						Results
93						Cloning of Bam32 , A Novel GC associated Signaling Adaptor .
94						To identify genes expressed in GCs , we carried out an SSH experiment using an enriched preparation of human FDCs as a source of tester cDNA ( see Materials and Methods ) .
95						PCR analysis indicated that our tester cDNA included both transcripts derived from FDCs and transcripts derived from adhering B cells ( data not shown ) .
96						One of the differentially expressed clones isolated from this subtraction experiment contained a partial coding sequence for a novel SH2 domain containing protein .
97						Several cDNA clones containing the entire protein coding sequence for this gene were obtained by screening a human lymph node cDNA library .
98						The cDNA sequence predicts a 32-kD protein containing an NH 2 -terminal SH2 domain and a COOH-terminal PH domain , but lacking any known catalytic domains ( A ) .
99						The sequence contains 10 tyrosines , 1 of which matches the consensus motif for a tyrosine phosphorylation site .
100						Thus , this molecule represents a new member of the adaptor class of signaling molecules .
101						Based on this structure and the restricted expression pattern of this gene ( see below ) , we have designated this molecule Bam32 for B lymphocyte adaptor molecule of 32 kD .
102						The murine Bam32 homologue was isolated by low stringency PCR , followed by RACE ( A ) .
103						Murine Bam32 shares 96.7 % sequence identity with the human protein within the central portion containing the SH2 and PH domains .
104						In contrast , the NH 2 -terminal region is less well conserved ( 76.5 % identity ) , while the COOH-terminal 20 amino acids are completely different than our human clones .
105						However , the expressed sequence tag ( EST ) database contains an alternatively spliced human Bam32 cDNA sequence that encodes a COOH-terminal sequence corresponding to our mouse Bam32 clone ( 82.6 % identity ) .
106						We designate the two human splice forms hbam1 and hbam2 and the corresponding murine sequence mbam1 ( A ) .
107						The chromosomal location of the human Bam32 gene was determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization ( FISH ) on banded human metaphase chromosomes .
108						In the majority of cells examined ( 44 and 67 ) , clear signals were observed on both chromatids of chromosome 4 at band q25-q27 ( B ) .
109						Bam32 Is Expressed by B Lymphocytes , but Not T Cells or Nonhematopoietic Cells .
110						Expression of Bam32 in human tissues was determined by Northern blot analysis ( A ) .
111						Our Bam32 cDNA probe detects both a predominant 2.9-kb transcript , corresponding in size to our largest cDNA clones , and a much less abundant 4.4-kb transcript .
112						Bam32 transcripts are detected in all hematopoietic tissues tested ( bone marrow , spleen , lymph node , and peripheral blood leukocytes ) with the exception of the thymus , which shows little or no expression .
113						Bam32 expression was also observed in trachea and placenta , but not in 14 other nonlymphoid tissues including brain , heart , kidney , liver and skeletal muscle , indicating that expression is largely confined to cells of the immune system .
114						Consistent with the restricted tissue distribution pattern , RT-PCR analyses indicated that Bam32 is expressed in all B cell lines examined , but not in T cell , epithelial cell , fibroblast , or myelocytic leukemia lines ( B ) .
115						As expected , Bam32 transcripts were detected in the sort enriched tonsillar FDC tester RNA , but not in the fibroblast pool driver RNA .
116						Bam32 Expression Is Increased upon B Cell Activation .
117						Since Bam32 was isolated as a GC associated gene , it was of interest to compare the expression of Bam32 at different stages of B cell differentiation .
118						Therefore , we fractionated human tonsillar B cells into naive , GC , and memory subsets on the basis of CD38 and IgD expression .
119						While Bam32 transcripts were detected in all fractions , GC B cells expressed fourfold higher levels than naive B cells ( A ) .
120						Furthermore , the memory B cell fraction expressed 15-fold lower levels of Bam32 transcripts than GC B cells .
121						These results suggest that Bam32 expression levels are modulated during B cell activation and differentiation .
122	uaz:UA-CLine-100005	B cells	c3			To further investigate the activation signals that might regulate Bam32 expression , resting B cells were stimulated in vitro with CD40 antibodies and Bam32 expression was determined .
123			e19	c3	CD40 ligation led to a 5-10-fold increase in Bam32 expression	CD40 ligation led to a 5-10-fold increase in Bam32 expression , whereas BCR ligation had no significant effect ( B ) .
124						Together , these results suggest that Bam32 expression is specifically increased during T cell dependent activation , is maintained at high levels during the subsequent GC response , and then decreases upon differentiation to memory B cells .
125			e20,e21	c3	Bam32 Is Phosphorylated on Tyrosine and Associates with PLCgamma2 after BCR Ligation or Pervanadate Stimulation .	Bam32 Is Phosphorylated on Tyrosine and Associates with PLCgamma2 after BCR Ligation or Pervanadate Stimulation .
126						To determine whether Bam32 associates with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins after B cell activation , Bam32 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of resting or activated B cells and the precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted with biotinylated phosphotyrosine specific mAb followed by streptavidin-peroxidase ( A ) .
127						Two predominant tyrosine phosphorylated proteins running at ~ 140 and 35 and 36 kD were detected in Bam32 immunoprecipitates from BCR- or pervanadate stimulated Ramos cells .
128						As expected , neither of these bands was observed in immunoprecipitates from pervanadate stimulated Jurkat cells , which do not express Bam32 .
129						We found no evidence for a phosphoprotein running at 32 kD ; however , when Bam32 immunoprecipitates were blotted with polyclonal Bam32 antibodies , an additional band of ~ 35 and 36 kD was detectable after BCR or pervanadate activation ( A , bottom ) .
130						This band was not present in unstimulated cells and comigrated with the 35 and 36 kD band detected by antiphosphotyrosine blotting , indicating that it represents tyrosine phosphorylated Bam32 .
131						Consistent with this conclusion , myc epitope tagged Bam32 also underwent a bandshift and was tyrosine phosphorylated after pervanadate stimulation ( B ) .
132						Western blot analyses identified the 140-kD associated protein as PLCgamma2 , whereas neither PLCgamma1 nor BLNK could be detected in Bam32 immunoprecipitates ( A ) .
133			e22	c3	constitutive association of Bam32 with PLCgamma2	Although we can detect some constitutive association of Bam32 with PLCgamma2 , association is substantially increased after activation ( B ) .

137			e27	c3	Bam32 Is Recruited to the Plasma Membrane 	Bam32 Is Recruited to the Plasma Membrane after BCR Cross Linking Via Its PH Domain .
138						We hypothesized that Bam32 may associate with the plasma membrane through binding of its PH domain to phosphoinositides generated by PI3K , as observed with a subset of PH domain containing proteins , including Btk in B cells .
139						To determine the subcellular localization of Bam32 before and after BCR cross linking , we transfected BJAB B cells with constructs encoding EGFP or EGFP fused to Bam32 and examined the subcellular localization of the fusion proteins by confocal fluorescence microscopy .
140			e28	c3	a proportion of the EGFP-Bam32 fusion protein was associated with the plasma membrane ( A ) .	While the native EGFP showed only diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear signal , a proportion of the EGFP-Bam32 fusion protein was associated with the plasma membrane ( A ) .
141						Membrane localization of Bam32-EGFP was increased by approximately threefold after BCR cross linking ( A , and data not shown ) .
142			e291	c3	the NH 2 -terminal half of Bam32 containing the SH2 domain or the COOH-terminal half containing the PH domain was independently expressed as a fusion with EGFP .	To determine which domains of Bam32 are required for membrane association , the NH 2 -terminal half of Bam32 containing the SH2 domain or the COOH-terminal half containing the PH domain was independently expressed as a fusion with EGFP .
143			e29	c3	We found that the SH2 domain fusion localized to the cytoplasm , whereas the PH domain fusion showed a clear association with the plasma membrane that increased after BCR ligation ( A ) .	We found that the SH2 domain fusion localized to the cytoplasm , whereas the PH domain fusion showed a clear association with the plasma membrane that increased after BCR ligation ( A ) .
144						The full-length Bam32 fusion and the PH domain fusion show similar levels of basal and induced membrane association , indicating that the PH domain is both necessary and sufficient for membrane recruitment .
145	uaz:UA-CLine-100005	B cells	e30,c4	c4	Bam32 membrane association	The surprisingly high basal level of Bam32 membrane association in BJAB B cells , which was not observed with the Btk PH domain in NIH 3T3 cells , prompted us to compare the relative levels and kinetics of membrane association of the Bam32 and Btk PH domains after BCR ligation ( B ) .
146						By quantifying relative fluorescence levels in the plasma membrane versus the cytoplasm at various time points after stimulation , we found that membrane recruitment of the Bam32 PH domain was evident within 1 min of BCR stimulation , peaks at ~ 5 min , and then slowly declines back to basal levels .
147						The Btk PH domain was recruited with similar kinetics ; however , a significantly lower proportion of the fusion protein is present at the plasma membrane ( relative to the cytoplasm ) at each time point , and membrane association was not observed in unstimulated cells ( B ) .
148						Unlike Bam32 , a significant proportion of the Btk PH domain fusion protein localized to the nucleus as observed previously .
149			e31,e32	c4	These results suggest that the Bam32 PH domain is rapidly and quantitatively recruited to the plasma membrane after BCR ligation , and may have a higher selectively for binding to the activated plasma membrane than the Btk PH domain .

152			e36	c4	 membrane association of both the PH domain and Bam32 as a whole is dependent on PI3K activity .	These inhibitors blocked membrane association of both fusion proteins , demonstrating that membrane association of both the PH domain and Bam32 as a whole is dependent on PI3K activity .
153						Alignment of the Bam32 PH domain with other PH domains reveals that Bam32 contains a series of amino acids in the beta2 and beta3 strands that are conserved among PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 -binding PH domains , including the arginine corresponding to R28 in Btk , which is mutated in human X linked agammaglobulinemia patients and Xid mice , and which forms part of the PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 -binding pocket .
154						To test whether membrane association of the Bam32 PH domain requires the conserved arginine in this putative PI ( 3,4,5 ) 3 -binding pocket , we generated a construct encoding EGFP fused to the Bam32 PH domain bearing an R184C mutation .
155			e37	c4	association of the Bam32 PH domain occurs through direct binding to PI ( 3,4,5 ) 3 .	The R184C mutation completely abrogated membrane association ( B ) , providing support for the hypothesis that the PI3K dependent association of the Bam32 PH domain occurs through direct binding to PI ( 3,4,5 ) 3 .
156						Interestingly , when aligned with the Btk PH domain , the Bam32 PH domain also contains an amino acid substitution in the beta3 strand found in a gain-of-function Btk mutant that shows constitutive membrane association ( E41K ; references 14 , 38 ) .
157						To examine the role of this residue in Bam32 membrane association , we generated a K197E mutant PH domain and examined membrane association ( B ) .
158						Surprisingly , the K197E mutation also completely disrupted membrane association , suggesting that this residue , which is not conserved among phosphoinositide binding PH domains , has a critical role in phosphoinositide binding of the Bam32 PH domain .
159						We have confirmed the effect of the R28C and K41E mutations on membrane association by immunofluorescence staining of full-length Bam32 proteins expressed in BJAB cells ( data not shown ) .

161						Bam32 Can Modulate BCR induced Transcriptional Activation .
162						To determine whether the presence of Bam32 in membrane associated signaling complexes can regulate signaling through the BCR , we assessed the effect of overexpressing wild-type or mutant Bam32 proteins , using downstream transcriptional activation as a readout for BCR signaling .
163						Bam32 expression constructs were cotransfected into BJAB cells with a luciferase reporter construct that allows measurement of transcription mediated by NF-AT , a family of transcription factors that are important regulators of both B and T cell activation responses .

167						Cells expressing full-length Bam32 containing the R184C or K197E mutations showed similar or slightly increased BCR induced NF-AT activation compared with controls ( C ) , indicating that PI ( 3,4,5 ) 3 -mediated membrane recruitment of Bam32 is required for the inhibitory effect .

171						Discussion
172						Studies of genetically deficient animals or humans have implicated adaptor proteins as critical regulators and integrators of signaling pathways in lymphocytes .
173						The Bam32 molecule described in this report represents a new and unique addition to the growing family of hematopoietic cell restricted signaling adaptor proteins that regulate lymphocyte signal transduction .
174						Compared with the known group of hematopoietic cell restricted adaptor proteins , Bam32 is distinguished by its small size and its simple two-domain structure .
175						Perhaps due to this compact structure , the Bam32 amino acid sequence is highly conserved between different species , with mouse Bam32 showing > 90 % identity to human and chicken Bam32 showing > 80 % identity to human ( Maeda , A. , H. Niiro , A.J. Marshall , E.A. Clark , and T. Kurosaki , unpublished data ) .
176						Expression and Chromosomal Location of Bam32 .
177						Bam32 is clearly expressed in B , but not T lymphocytes ; however , the present data do not rule out expression in myeloid or other hematopoietic lineages .
178						Indeed , Bam32 is expressed at high levels in the trachea , which contains few lymphocytes but significant numbers of dendritic cells .
179						Our preliminary results suggest that Bam32 is expressed in monocyte derived dendritic cells ( Marshall , A.J. , D. Magaletti , and E.A. Clark , unpublished data ) , which could potentially account for Bam32 expression in the trachea .
180						In the B lineage , Bam32 is expressed as early as the pre-B cell stage ( Marshall , A.J. , and E.A. Clark , unpublished data ) .
181						Expression in mature B cells is modulated during activation and subsequent differentiation , with a marked increase in expression during the naive to GC B cell transition , and a dramatic decrease in memory B cells .
182						Among human B cell lines , we observe the highest levels of Bam32 protein in the typical Burkitt 's lymphoma lines Ramos and Daudi ( data not shown ) , which share many features with GC B cells .
183						Finally , we find that cross linking CD40 on naive B cells , which can turn on some phenotypic characteristics of GC B cells , leads to a rapid increase in Bam32 expression ( B ) .
184						Interestingly , BCR ligation alone does not significantly affect Bam32 expression , and does not affect upregulation when used in combination with CD40 ligation , suggesting that transcription of Bam32 is specifically CD40 responsive .
185						Together , these data strongly suggest that Bam32 expression is increased during T cell dependent B cell activation and the subsequent GC response .
186						It is tempting to speculate that Bam32 upregulation may be an important factor in the cross-talk between CD40 and BCR signaling pathways and and or in tuning B cell responses to antigen during affinity maturation in GCs .
187						The human Bam32 gene is located on chromosome 4 q25-q27 , an interval containing several other immunologically relevant genes such as IL-2 , epidermal growth factor , fibroblast growth factor 2 , caspase 6 , I factor ( complement ) , and lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 .
188						Consistent with the chromosomal assignment , the Bam32 cDNA sequence matches a sequence tagged site ( STS ) on chromosome 4 ( data not shown ) .
189						Interestingly , loss of this region of chromosome 4 is observed in many Hodgkin 's lymphomas , which are thought to originate from GC B cells .
190						Given that Bam32 may negatively regulate NF-AT activation in B cells , it will be important to determine whether defects in Bam32 expression could contribute to increased B cell proliferation and potentially malignant transformation in Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
191			e56	c6	Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Bam32 .	Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Bam32 .
192			e57	c6	Bam32 is tyrosine phosphorylated after BCR ligation	Bam32 is tyrosine phosphorylated after BCR ligation , indicating that it is a target of a kinase activated downstream of the BCR .
193						While Bam32 contains 10 tyrosine residues , only 1 ( Y139 ) matches the general consensus motif for a tyrosine phosphorylation site in which a basic followed by an acidic amino acid are present 4-6 residues NH 2 -terminal to the tyrosine .
194						This tyrosine lies in an SIYESV motif , which fits the preferred target sequence for src family kinases ( I/L-Y-D/E ) , but not for syk kinase ( D-Y-E ) .
195						When phosphorylated , this site could form a target for binding of some SH2 domain containing proteins .
196			e58	c6	phosphorylation of Bam32	The phosphorylation of Bam32 correlates with a bandshift of 2-3 kD on our SDS-PAGE gels , suggesting that either phosphorylation at tyrosine 139 leads a stable conformational change that retards the migration of Bam32 , ( b ) phosphorylation at tyrosine 139 is upstream of multiple phosphorylations by serine and threonine kinases , or ( c ) Bam32 is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines not conforming to the consensus tyrosine phosphorylation site .
197						We have found that phosphorylated Bam32 is poorly recognized by our mAb , consistent with a stable conformational change .
198			e59,e60	c6	 Bam32 phosphorylation is inhibited by wortmannin pretreatment |  Bam32 is required for its phosphorylation and and or that activation of the kinase responsible is dependent on PI3K activity .	Interestingly , preliminary evidence indicates that Bam32 phosphorylation is inhibited by wortmannin pretreatment ( Niiro , H. , A.J. Marshall , and E.A. Clark , unpublished ) , suggesting that membrane recruitment of Bam32 is required for its phosphorylation and and or that activation of the kinase responsible is dependent on PI3K activity .
199						Structure and Function of the Bam32 SH2 Domain .
200						BLAST sequence similarity searching ( available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST ) indicated that the Bam32 SH2 domain is most highly related ( 30-37 % identity ) to those of the adaptor protein Nck , PLCgamma1 , PI3K p85 subunit , and the protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 .
201						The Bam32 SH2 domain shows the greatest overall similarity with the Nck SH2 domain ( 37 % identity , 62 % similarity ) , including identical residues at the betaD3 and betaD5 positions , which are thought to be critical in determining specificity of binding to phosphotyrosine motifs .
202						Despite the similarity with the Nck SH2 domain , we have been unable to detect association of Bam32 with proteins known to associate with Nck in activated lymphocytes such as BLNK , p62 DOK , and p120 Ras-GAP ( Niiro , H. , A.J. Marshall , and E.A. Clark , unpublished data ) .
203						However , we can clearly detect association of Bam32 with PLCgamma2 in vivo .
204			e61	c6	Our results indicate that the Bam32 SH2 domain can directly bind phosphorylated PLCgamma2 in vitro	Our results indicate that the Bam32 SH2 domain can directly bind phosphorylated PLCgamma2 in vitro ; however , we can not exclude the possibility that the in vivo interaction is mediated by another protein .
205						The finding that PLCgamma2 but not PLCgamma1 can be detected in Bam32 immunoprecipitates is intriguing , and could be due to differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation motifs present in these two isoforms .
206						However , we did detect some binding of the Bam32 SH2 domain to tyrosine phosphorylated PLCgamma1 in vitro , so we can not completely exclude the possibility of a low stoichiometry association between Bam32 and PLCgamma1 in vivo .
207						Structure and Function of the Bam32 PH Domain .
208						The PH domain of Bam32 appears to be both necessary and sufficient for membrane association of Bam32 ( A ) .
209						We have observed no significant differences in the behavior of the full-length Bam32 fusion protein and the PH domain fusion protein in terms of the level of basal or induced membrane association or the sensitivity of membrane association to PI3K inhibitors ; however , the present experiments do not rule out a contribution of the SH2 domain in regulating Bam32 localization .
210			e62,e63,e64,e65	c6	Grp1 , cytohesin-1 , and ADP ribosylation factor nucleotide binding site opener ( ARNO ) , which bind to 3-phosphoinositides generated by PI3K 57585960	The PH domain of Bam32 is related ( 39 % identity ) to those of Grp1 , cytohesin-1 , and ADP ribosylation factor nucleotide binding site opener ( ARNO ) , which bind to 3-phosphoinositides generated by PI3K .
211						Bam32 , like Grp1 , Akt , and Btk also contains a series of conserved residues in the beta1 and beta2 strands of the PH domain that correlate with the ability to bind 3-phosphoinositides .
212						Thus , the structure of the Bam32 PH domain is consistent with the hypothesis that it functions as a mediator of PI3K dependent membrane association through binding of 3-phosphoinositides .
213			e66	c6	association of Bam32 with the plasma membrane is strictly dependent on PI3K activity and an intact PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 -binding motif in the PH domain .	Indeed , we find that association of Bam32 with the plasma membrane is strictly dependent on PI3K activity and an intact PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 -binding motif in the PH domain .
214						During preparation of this manuscript , a molecule identical to Bam32 was described under the name DAPP1 , for dual adaptor for phosphotyrosine and 3-phosphoinositides .
215						In that report , the PH domain of DAPP1 was found to bind in vitro to the PI3K products PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 and PI ( 3,4 ) P 2 , consistent with our in vivo findings of PI3K dependent membrane recruitment .
216			e67,e68	c6	Btk is another example of a B cell specific protein that is recruited to the plasma membrane through its PH domain in a PI3K dependent manner , through direct binding to PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 .	Btk is another example of a B cell specific protein that is recruited to the plasma membrane through its PH domain in a PI3K dependent manner , through direct binding to PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 .
217						PH domain dependent membrane recruitment of Btk is functionally relevant because point mutations that prevent membrane recruitment block Btk activation , leading to defective B cell development in X linked agammaglobulinemia , and point mutations that cause constitutive membrane association lead to constitutively active Btk .
218			e69	c6	 Bam32 PH domain associates with the plasma membrane of activated B cells with higher stoichiometry than the Btk PH domain	Interestingly , direct comparison of the membrane recruitment of the Bam32 versus Btk PH domains indicated that the Bam32 PH domain associates with the plasma membrane of activated B cells with higher stoichiometry than the Btk PH domain ( B ) .
219						Since our analysis considers the ratio of localization to the membrane versus the cytoplasm , this difference could be accounted for by a difference in their relative affinity for phosphoinositide ligands in the membrane or differences in affinity for potential protein ligands in the membrane or cytoplasm .
220			e70,e71	c6	The Bam32 and DAPP1 PH domain was estimated to bind PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 with an affinity of 3 nM , compared with 60 nM for 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 ( PDK1 ) , which was used as an internal control in that study .	The Bam32 and DAPP1 PH domain was estimated to bind PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 with an affinity of 3 nM , compared with 60 nM for 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 ( PDK1 ) , which was used as an internal control in that study .
221			e72	c6	In contrast , the Btk PH domain was estimated to bind PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 with an affinity of 800 nM .	In contrast , the Btk PH domain was estimated to bind PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 with an affinity of 800 nM .
222			e73	c6	Thus , the Bam32 PH domain appears to bind PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 with an unusually high affinity .	Thus , the Bam32 PH domain appears to bind PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 with an unusually high affinity .
223						Role of Bam32 in B Cell Activation .
224						The restricted expression pattern of Bam32 , together with its upregulation during B cell activation , strongly suggests that Bam32 functions as a specific regulator of B cell signaling pathways .
225						Regulation of Bam32 levels during B cell differentiation could potentially modulate the stoichiometry and and or kinetics of membrane associated signaling complexes formed downstream of PI3K activation , thus altering the downstream consequences of activation signals .
226			e74,e75	c6	 Bam32 is one of the first proteins recruited during activation of PI3K and and or that Bam32 can be recruited by lower levels of PI3K activation than these other proteins .	Given the apparent hierarchy of affinities present in PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 -binding proteins ( Bam32 -- > PDK1 -- > Btk and Akt ) , it seems likely that Bam32 is one of the first proteins recruited during activation of PI3K and and or that Bam32 can be recruited by lower levels of PI3K activation than these other proteins .
227			e76	c6	Consistent with this idea , our data indicate that basal levels of PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 may be sufficient for some Bam32 to associate with the plasma membrane so that Bam32 is at the membrane before BCR activation .	Consistent with this idea , our data indicate that basal levels of PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 may be sufficient for some Bam32 to associate with the plasma membrane so that Bam32 is at the membrane before BCR activation .
228						Our present hypothesis , which we are currently testing , is that Bam32 regulates the activity of protein kinases that are recruited later in the PI3K dependent cascade , such as Btk or Akt .
229						Our results indicate that one downstream effect of increasing Bam32 levels is an inhibition of BCR induced activation of NF-AT .
230						Although it is difficult to conclude simply from overexpression studies what precise role Bam32 plays in BCR signaling , it is clear that Bam32 can regulate the BCR signal transduction upstream of NF-AT .

232	uaz:UA-CLine-100005	B cells	e79,c9	c9	 PI3K inhibitors leads to inhibition of BCR induced NF-AT activation	We find that treatment of BJAB B cells with PI3K inhibitors leads to inhibition of BCR induced NF-AT activation ( D ) , indicating that the PI3K pathway recruits essential effectors upstream of NF-AT activation in B cells .
233						The requirement for PI3K in NF-AT activation may reflect , at least in part , the role of PI3K in activation of PLCgamma and subsequently Ca 2+ mobilization .
234						Recent work has implicated Btk as a PI3K dependent effector which is required for full activation of PLCgamma leading to influx of Ca 2+ across the plasma membrane .
235			e80,e81,e82	c9	Since Bam32 binds the same phospholipid as Btk and associates with PLCgamma2	Since Bam32 binds the same phospholipid as Btk and associates with PLCgamma2 , it is tempting to speculate that Bam32 could regulate the activation of PLCgamma2 by Btk .
236			e83	c9	Overexpression of Bam32 in BJAB cells to levels that inhibit NF-AT activation	Overexpression of Bam32 in BJAB cells to levels that inhibit NF-AT activation by > 50 % does not lead to detectable changes in BCR induced Ca 2+ flux ( data not shown ) ; however , it remains possible that Bam32 regulates the sustained phase of the Ca 2+ response , which is Btk dependent and critical for full activation of NF-AT-dependent transcription .
237						Another possibility is that Bam32 could modulate NF-AT activation by regulating Ca 2+ -independent signaling events downstream of PI3K , such as Akt activation .
238						Akt could regulate NF-AT activation through phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 , whose activity opposes calcineurin dependent translocation of NF-AT to the nucleus .
239						Expression of constitutively active Akt enhances TCR induced NF-AT activation , consistent with a role for Akt in NF-AT activation .
240						The PI3K pathway has been shown to be essential for B cell activation and differentiation in studies examining the effect of PI3K inhibitors on B cell responses in vitro and the effect of PI3K p85alpha deficiency in mice .
241						Furthermore , the PI3K pathway is subject to opposing regulation by the CD19 coreceptor , which recruits PI3K to the antigen receptor complex , and the inhibitory Fc receptor FcgammaRII , which specifically antagonizes the PI3K pathway by recruiting the inositol phosphatase SHIP .
242						Bam32 is clearly a novel component of this critical PI3K activation pathway in B lymphocytes , and our results suggest that it may specifically regulate PI3K dependent effectors involved in activation of NF-AT .

244						In contrast , B cells from NF-ATp-deficient mice are hyperproliferative and B cells from NF-AT4-deficient mice show an activated phenotype in vivo .
245						We speculate that upregulation of Bam32 during the GC response may lead to qualitative changes in BCR signaling to the nucleus necessary for the exquisitely sensitive process of selection based on affinity for antigen .
