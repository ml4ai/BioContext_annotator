10						Introduction
11						Gliomas are the most common tumor in the central nervous system , with an incidence rate of 5 to 10 per 100,000 for the malignant form .
12						Based on their histological characteristics and expression of lineage markers , gliomas can be classified into astrocytoma , oligodendroglioma , and ependymoma .
13						Astrocytomas account for 60 % of all primary brain tumors and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification system grades them on a scale of I to IV according to their increasing degree of malignancy .
14						Among them , Grade IV is one of the most highly invasive types of tumor , characterized by microvascular proliferation .
15						Its aggressive infiltrative growth leads to an extremely high recurrence rate within a short period of time even after radical surgical resection .
16						Worse still , many glioblastomas are found to be resistant to chemo- or radiotherapy due to DNA repair by the protein O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase ( MGMT ) and impaired apoptotic pathways .
17						Median survival after initial diagnosis is therefore currently only around 12 to 18 months .
18						This apparently calls for a more thorough understanding of the pathoetiology at both cellular and molecular level to provide insight into the devise of novel and effective therapeutic treatments .
19						This paper revisits the biological features of various genetic pathways deregulated in human gliomas , followed by an overview of the involvement of semaphorins and their receptors in these signalings that lead to their emerging role in the regulation of gliomagenesis .
20						2 .
21						Classification of Astrocytomas
22						Astrocytomas can be categorized into localized and diffuse forms .
23						Localized astrocytic tumors exhibit a circumscribed growth pattern with limited capacity for parenchymal infiltration .
24						Pilocytic astrocytomas for instance , are slow growing tumors that occur primarily in children or young adults .
25						They are mostly nonaggressive and show little or no tendency to undergo anaplastic malignant transformation .
26						This type of astrocytic tumor is classified as WHO grade I and is often curable if the tumor is resectable .
27						Histologically , Rosenthal fibers are often observed on tumor sections .
28						By contrast , diffuse astrocytomas are characterized by their high infiltration into peritumoral regions and dispersal to distant sites .
29						Based on the WHO classification , they are subdivided into low-grade astrocytoma ( grade II ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( grade III ) , and glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) .
30						Low-grade diffuse astrocytoma is characterized by slow growth and infiltration of neighboring brain structures .
31						Histologically , the tumors are characterized by low to moderate cellularity .
32						Cancer cells are well differentiated and show resemblance to astrocytes with little nuclear atypia .
33						Also known as fibrillary astrocytomas , these cancers are believed to arise from neoplastic astrocytes .
34						In fact , the cancer cells produce cytoplasmic processes that form a rich fibrillary stroma around the neoplasm , hence giving rise to a diffuse outline of the tumor in scans .
35						These grade II tumors typically affect young adults ( age of 25-50 ) and are treatable , with a mean survival of 6 years after surgical intervention .
36						Nonetheless , the prognosis varies because of the tendency for these tumors to undergo malignant transformation to higher grades .
37						Anaplastic astrocytoma is highly proliferative and infiltrative .
38						"It is not uncommon that cells of these grade III malignant tumors invade along the white matter tracts and give rise to a classic "" butterfly "" pattern of spread at the corpus callosum ."
39						While histological characteristics of astrocytes can still be observed , the tumor cells become more pleomorphic with distinct nuclear atypia .
40						They show increased mitotic activity and cellularity .
41						Notably , anaplastic astrocytoma may develop de novo as primary tumor or arise from a grade II diffuse astrocytoma as secondary tumor .
42						Afflicted patients are usually around the age of 40 .
43						Treatment regimens include surgical resection , radiation , and chemotherapy .
44						Owing to the high invasiveness and aggressiveness , however , high recurrence rate is often observed within 2 years , during which the cancer typically would have progressed to high-grade glioblastoma .
45						GBM is the most invasive and malignant form of diffuse astrocytomas , and is one of the most aggressive type of human neoplasms .
46						Histologically , the cancer cells are anaplastic and poorly differentiated .
47						The pleomorphic astrocytic tumor cells show marked nuclear atypia and high mitotic activity .
48						Rapid proliferation of the malignant cancer cells is accompanied by microvascular proliferation , though hypoxia is often resulted , leading to necrosis in the tumor core .
49						In fact , neovascularization and necrotic cell death are the two major histopathological hallmarks for the diagnosis of glioblastomas versus anaplastic astrocytomas .
50						Glioblastomas can be subdivided into primary or secondary form .
51						Primary GBMs account for 60 % of cases in adults above 45 years old .
52						These tumors arise de novo with no sign of a preexisting less malignant precursor lesion .
53						In contrast , secondary GBMs typically develop in patients below the age of 45 through malignant progression from lower grade diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma in a span of one to ten years .
54						At molecular level , the genetic lesions in primary and secondary GBMs also differ .
55						Glioblastoma occurs most frequently in the cerebral hemisphere of adults between the ages of 45 and 70 .
56						Owing to the wide infiltration of glioblastoma cells , it is impossible to eradicate them by surgical means .
57						In addition to their resistance to radio- and chemotherapy , recurrence rate of GBMs is close to 100 % .
58						A median survival of approximately one year is therefore commonly seen in the afflicted patients despite aggressive multimodality treatment regimens .
59						3 .
60						Genetic Pathways Deregulated in Glioblastomas
61						Although lower-grade gliomas ( II and III ) can undergo malignant progression to become secondary glioblastoma , most GBMs are diagnosed as de novo primary glioblastoma without sign of antecedent lower-grade tumor .
62						Primary GBMs typically show gene amplification and mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , deletion or loss-of-function mutations of the phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) at chromosome 10 , and less frequently gene amplification of the p53 inhibitor human double minute 2 ( HDM2 ) .
63						Deregulation of these pathways is believed to contribute to the self sustained proliferation , resistance to apoptosis , and highly invasive features of glioblastoma .
64						3.1 .
65						Hyperactivation of the EGFR-PI3K-AKT Pathway
66						The EGFR gene is located on 7p12 .1 , which encodes a cell membrane receptor of the ErbB family .
67			e1,e2	t1,c1	Upon activation by its ligands EGF or TGFalpha , EGFR undergo homodimerization to stimulate its intrinsic intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase activity .	Upon activation by its ligands EGF or TGFalpha , EGFR undergo homodimerization to stimulate its intrinsic intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase activity .
68						This triggers the downstream signaling cascades PI3K-AKT-GSK3beta-Rac1 and the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK , which controls important functions such as cell survival , proliferation , and motility .
69						Deregulation of EGFR , mostly in the form of gene amplification or overexpression is commonly found in primary GBMs .
70						The majority of GBMs with EGFR amplification also express the variant EGFRvIII , a mutant generated from an in-frame deletion of exons 2 to 7 that results in truncation of the extracellular domain .
71						EGFRvIII is unresponsive to EGF stimulation but exhibits ligand independent constitutive activity .

Notably , the levels of phospho-PI3K and phospho-AKT are inversely associated with that of cleaved caspase 3 , suggesting the association of activated PI3K pathway with reduced level of apoptosis commonly observed in GBMs .
75						This partly accounts for the resistance of glioblastomas to radiotherapy .
76						Ironically , there is evidence that shows activation of EGFRvIII by radiation , posing a concern in prescribing radiotherapy as a treatment regimen in the management of glioblastomas .
77			e10,e11,e12,e13,e14	t1,c1	 PI3K and AKT and PKB can activate Rac1 , which in turn triggers TIMP2 , MMP2 , and MMP9 pathway to promote cell invasion	Furthermore , PI3K and AKT and PKB can activate Rac1 , which in turn triggers TIMP2 , MMP2 , and MMP9 pathway to promote cell invasion .
78						3.2 .
79						Hyperactivation of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK Pathway Causes High Proliferation and Resistance to Apoptosis in Glioblastomas
80			e15	t1,c1	activated EGFR also triggers the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway .	In addition to PI3K signaling , activated EGFR also triggers the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway .
81			e16,e17,e18,e19,e20	t1,c1	several growth factor pathways that are aberrantly activated in glioblastomas , including platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , insulin like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , hepatocyte growth factor and scatter factor ( HGF and SF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) also converge to Ras activation .	In fact , several growth factor pathways that are aberrantly activated in glioblastomas , including platelet derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , insulin like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , hepatocyte growth factor and scatter factor ( HGF and SF ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , and transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta ) also converge to Ras activation .
82						High level of activated Ras is always found in glioma cell lines and glioblastoma biopsies .
83						This is in contrast to many other cancer types where Ras is abnormally activated by oncogenic mutations .
84			e21,e22	t1,c1	Active Ras recruits Raf kinase to the membrane , where it is primed by phosphorylation .	Active Ras recruits Raf kinase to the membrane , where it is primed by phosphorylation .
85			e23	t1,c1	Raf in turn activates MEK and ERK .	Raf in turn activates MEK and ERK .
86						Activated ERK then translocates into the nucleus to activate various transcription factors to induce cell cycle progression and antiapoptotic signalings .
87						Importantly , blockade of Ras activation in gliomas slows down cancer cell proliferation .
88						Application of Ras inhibitor also reduces migration of U87-MG gliomas cells .
89						The deregulation of signalings in gliomas is further complicated by intensive cross-talk between the Ras and the PI3K pathways .
90			e26	t1,c1	Ras is known to stimulate PI3K through physical association , which activates PI3K mediated antiapoptotic processes and hence contributes to Ras oncogenicity .

91			e27	t1,c1	Conversely , PI3K was proposed to participate in ERK1 and 2 activation .	Conversely , PI3K was proposed to participate in ERK1 and 2 activation .
92						In summary , aberrant activation of specific receptor tyrosine kinases in gliomas elicits both the Ras and the PI3K cascades , leading to promotion of cancer cell proliferation , survival , motility , and resistance to apoptosis .
93						3.3 .
94						Loss of PTEN Functions Is Associated with Glioblastomas
95						Located at 10q23 .3 , the PTEN gene encodes a protein that contains a tensin like domain and a catalytic domain at the N-terminus similar to that of the dual-specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases .
96			e30,e31	t1,c1	it was found that the phosphatase activity of PTEN exhibits substrate preference towards phosphoinositide such as phosphatidylinositol ( 3,4,5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) .	Interestingly , it was found that the phosphatase activity of PTEN exhibits substrate preference towards phosphoinositide such as phosphatidylinositol ( 3,4,5 ) - trisphosphate ( PIP 3 ) .
97			e28,e29	t1,c1	PIP 3 is an important lipid product of PI3K that serves as second messenger for the activation of AKT and PKB , which promotes cell proliferation and survival through the inhibition of apoptotic cell death .	PIP 3 is an important lipid product of PI3K that serves as second messenger for the activation of AKT and PKB , which promotes cell proliferation and survival through the inhibition of apoptotic cell death .
98			e32	t1,c1	The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN in dephosphorylating PIP 3 into PIP 2 therefore serves as a negative regulator of PI3K signalings .	The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN in dephosphorylating PIP 3 into PIP 2 therefore serves as a negative regulator of PI3K signalings .
99						In addition to cell proliferation and apoptosis , PTEN is also involved in the regulation of glioma cell motility .
100						The central domain of PTEN shows protein tyrosine phosphatase activity , which directly dephosphorylates focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) in integrin complex , hence inhibiting integrin mediated migration and invasion [ - ] .
101			e33,e34	t1,c1	PTEN was found to directly dephosphorylate the SH2 containing adaptor protein ( Shc ) upstream of Ras , hence downregulating the Ras/Raf/MEK / ERK pathway	Furthermore , PTEN was found to directly dephosphorylate the SH2 containing adaptor protein ( Shc ) upstream of Ras , hence downregulating the Ras/Raf/MEK / ERK pathway and inhibits cell spreading , migration , and invasion .
102						Taken together , PTEN modulates the integrin-FAK and the Shc-Ras-MAPK pathways , thereby regulating both random and directional cell motility in glioma cells , respectively .
103			e35,e36,e37	t1,c1	U87-MG and U373-MG carry mutations in the PTEN gene that result in diminished or null expression of the protein , leading to aberrant activation of AKT , FAK [ - ] , and Ras in GBMs .	Notably , a majority of primary glioblastoma and established glioma cell lines such as U87-MG and U373-MG carry mutations in the PTEN gene that result in diminished or null expression of the protein , leading to aberrant activation of AKT , FAK [ - ] , and Ras in GBMs .
104						In fact , loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) 10q is one of the most common genetic aberrations in GBMs .
105						A complete loss of the entire chromosome 10 , where the PTEN gene resides is typical for primary glioblastomas .
106						The loss of PTEN check on PIP 3 and AKT and PKB signaling pathway in glioma therefore spares the cells from apoptosis and promote cell cycle progression .
107						Deregulation of PTEN functions could also render EGFR kinase-inhibitor therapy ineffective because of the dissociation of EGFR inhibition from downstream PI3K pathway inhibition .
108			e38,e39	t1,c1	PTEN functions in counteracting FAK and Ras signalings	Conceivably , a compromise of PTEN functions in counteracting FAK and Ras signalings contributes to the high basal cell motility and the progression of glioblastoma .
109						3.4 .
110						pRB Pathway
111						The retinoblastoma protein ( pRB ) is encoded by the RB1 gene located at 13q14 .1 .
112						pRB is a tumor suppressor protein that blocks cell cycle progression through G1 into S-phase , hence preventing cells from replicating damaged DNA .
113			e40,e41	t1,c1	pRb forms complexes with transcription factors of the E2F family and suppresses the coordinated transcription of genes necessary for DNA synthesis .	Mechanistically , pRb forms complexes with transcription factors of the E2F family and suppresses the coordinated transcription of genes necessary for DNA synthesis .

115			e45	t1,c1	The cell cycle arrest function of pRB is counteracted upon phosphorylation by the cyclin dependent kinases Cdk4 and Cdk6 , which form complexes with cyclin D1 , leading to a release of E2F and hence derepression of cell cycle progression .

122						Involvement of Axon Guidance Molecules in Glioma Progression
123						In addition to deregulation of the classical growth factor receptors and signaling pathways , increasing evidence suggests the involvement of novel players in the progression of gliomas .
124						Diffused gliomas are known to be highly infiltrative into the surrounding parenchyma of tumor mass even at low-grade .
125						This poses an immense challenge to clinical management of the disease and high recurrence rate is commonly observed even after radical surgical resection of the tumor .
126						Notably , clinical observations revealed a preferential invasion of gliomas along white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum .
127						Furthermore , cessation of glioma cell migration is often observed at the junction between the white and the grey matter .
128						These findings suggest the presence of tropic and guidance cues for the invasion of gliomas within the CNS .
129						In fact , accumulating evidence suggests the involvement of axon guidance molecules such as netrin , Slit , and semaphorins in glioma progression .
130						A recent study has demonstrated that netrin functions to inhibit glioma cell motility in an autocrine fashion .
131						A loss of expression of DCC ( Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma ) , the receptor for netrin has been found to correlate with glioma progression .
132						Similarly , Slit 2 inhibits glioma cell invasion in a Robo dependent manner , and its expression is epigenetically downregulated in gliomas .
133						Semaphorins are amongst the largest family of guidance molecules that trigger both repulsive and attractive axon guidance functions through different receptors and coreceptors .
134						Growing body of evidence indicates that semaphorins also subserve pro-tumorigenic and tumor suppressor roles in various cancer types , including gliomas [ - ] .
135						4.1 .
136						Semaphorins and Their Receptors Neuropilins and Plexins
137						Semaphorins , originally identified as guidance cues that navigate axons in the nervous system , fall into eight subclasses of secreted , membrane glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol ( GPI ) - anchored , and transmembrane proteins .
138						Semaphorins are characterized by the presence of a sema domain and a PSI ( plexins , semaphorins and integrins ) domain at the N-terminus , which are also present in their receptors plexins .
139						Most family members harbor the immunoglobulin ( Ig ) - like domain , which is a signature feature found in the Ig superfamily ( IgSF ) of cell adhesion or recognition molecules .
140						Class 5 semaphorins are distinctive due to the presence of multiple thrombospondin 1 ( TSP1 ) domains , which has been implicated in platelet aggregation , angiogenesis , and tumorigenesis .
141						To date , class 3 semaphorins are the most thoroughly studied for their physiological and pathological functions .
142						Interestingly , members of this class exist in secreted form and interact directly with the receptors neuropilin ( Nrp ) -1 or -2 , which have small intracellular tail and need to engage plexins as coreceptors for signal transduction functions .
143						Mammalian plexins are classified into four subfamilies plexin-A to -D , which share high homology in structural domains such as the sema domain and the cysteine rich motifs related to c-Met proto-oncogene .
144						Despite this , interactions between different subfamilies of plexins and semaphorins still show differential specificity , which trigger different sets of biological functions .
145						A second level of functional specificity is attained by the coupling of plexins with various coreceptors expressed in a cell- or tissue specific manner , such as neuropilins , L1 adhesion molecule , off-track ( Otk ) , c-Met proto-oncogene , the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 , CD72 , and Tim-2 [ - ] .
146						These lead to the implication of semaphorins and plexins in a vast array of biological processes beyond axon guidance , such as cell adhesion , cell motility , angiogenesis , immune responses , organogenesis , and tumorigenesis .
147						4.2 .
148						Semaphorins and Their Receptors in Tumorigenesis
149						The implication of semaphorins in cancer development was first suggested by the observation of a deletion of chromosomal region 3p21 , where Sema3B and Sema3F reside , in almost all cases of small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) [ - ] .
150						Ensuing research revealed that many class 3 semaphorins exhibit tumor suppressor function by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptotic cell death in cancer cells .
151						Sema3B , for instance induces apoptosis in lung and breast cancer , whereas Sema3F shows antiproliferative and antiangiogenic functions in melanoma , lung , breast , and colorectal cancers .
152						In addition , Sema3A and 3F were shown to inhibit cell migration of breast carcinoma and metastasis of melanoma , respectively , through their receptors neuropilins and plexins in an autocrine or paracrine manner .
153						Sema3A and Nrp -1 and Sema3F and Nrp -2 interactions also block endothelial cell migration and initiate antiangiogenic signaling cascades .
154						While Sema3A , 3B , and 3F demonstrate antitumorigenic or antiangiogenic properties in various cancer types , other members are implicated in the promotion of tumor progression .
155						Overexpression of Sema3C in prostate cancer cell lines promotes cell invasion .
156						An upregulation of Sema3E transcript has been observed in metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma cells .
157						Expression of Sema3E induces lung metastasis of mammary adenocarcinoma and promotes migration and growth of endothelial cells .
158						While the importance of semaphorins in cancer development is most well characterized in secreted class 3 members , transmembrane semaphorins of class 4 , 5 , and 6 begin to emerge as important players .
159						Sema4D is highly expressed in cell lines derived from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( HNSCCs ) .
160						When shed from HNSCC cells , Sema4D stimulates endothelial cell migration .
161						Silencing Sema4D expression by lentiviral shRNA dramatically reduces the size and vascularity of HNSCC tumor xenografts .
162						These findings suggest the angiogenic function of Sema4D .
163						An overexpression of Sema4D was found to be significantly correlated with lymph node and distant metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma .
164	tissuelist:TS-0739	pancreatic cancer cells	e50,e51,e52,c2	c2	 Sema4D triggers its receptor plexin-B1 and leads to the promotion of invasiveness through activation of the MAPK and the AKT pathway .	In vitro experiments revealed that stimulation of pancreatic cancer cells with Sema4D triggers its receptor plexin-B1 and leads to the promotion of invasiveness through activation of the MAPK and the AKT pathway .
165						In prostate cancers , a significant upregulation of both Sema4D and plexin-B1 has been observed .
166						Mutations have also been found in plexin-B1 that causes an impairment of its R-RasGAP activity , hence increasing cell motility and invasion .
167						In contrast to these oncogenic roles of Sema4D , however , various lines of evidence point to a tumor suppressor role of its receptor plexin-B1 .
168						For instance , a loss of plexin-B1 expression is associated with poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancer patients .
169						Plexin-B1 downregulation is also seen in renal cell carcinoma .
170	tissuelist:TS-0614	melanoma cells	e53,c3	c3	Tumor suppressor function of plexin-B1 has been demonstrated in melanoma cells , and its expression is downregulated by oncogenic B-Raf signaling via MEK and ERK pathway .	Tumor suppressor function of plexin-B1 has been demonstrated in melanoma cells , and its expression is downregulated by oncogenic B-Raf signaling via MEK and ERK pathway .
171						Divergent functions in cancer development is also implicated in class 6 semaphorins .
172						Sema6A inhibits both bFGF and VEGF and tumor cell line induced neovascularization , whereas an upregulation of Sema6D expression is associated with the development of gastric carcinoma .
173	tissuelist:TS-0614	melanoma cells	e54,c4	c4	A recent study has revealed the role of Sema7A in inhibiting cancer cell invasion by inactivation of cofilin through plexin-C1	A recent study has revealed the role of Sema7A in inhibiting cancer cell invasion by inactivation of cofilin through plexin-C1 , which is consistent with the observation of a downregulation of Sema7A in metastatic melanoma cells .
174						Among other members , class 5 semaphorins are peculiar due to the presence of thrombospondin repeats in the extracellular domain , which have been implicated in cancer cell motility and proliferation .
175	tissuelist:TS-0739,tissuelist:TS-1224,tissuelist:TS-0978	pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer	e55,t2,t3,t4	t2,t3,t4	The expression of semaphorin 5A ( Sema5A ) and its receptor plexin-B3	The expression of semaphorin 5A ( Sema5A ) and its receptor plexin-B3 was shown to be associated with the aggressive nature of pancreatic , prostate , and gastric cancers [ - ] .
176						Nonetheless , a recent report has demonstrated significant downregulation of Sema5A transcript and protein in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma , which correlates with poor survival of the patients , suggesting potential anticancer effect of Sema5A .
177						Consistent with this is a recent study that reports the presence a novel missense mutation in plexin-B3 in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas , which prevents interaction with its ligand Sema5A , hence impairing their signaling and contributing to tumor progression .
178						4.3 .
179						Semaphorins and Their Receptors in Gliomagenesis
180						The implication of semaphorins , neuropilins , and plexins in gliomagenesis was suggested by their presence in human glioma cells .
181						In particular , the downregulation of Sema6B expression in two human glioblastoma cell lines when treated with retinoic acid , an antitumor and differentiation inducing agent suggest its involvement in tumor formation .
182						To date , class 3 semaphorins remain the most well characterized subfamily in the development of gliomas .
183						An increase in expression of the Sema3B gene was found to be associated with poor prognosis and survival of glioma patients .
184						Yet a later study reported the opposite by demonstrating positive correlations of Sema3B , Sema3G and neuropilin-2 with prolonged survival in glioma patients .
185						Similarly , a protumorigenic role of Sema3A was implicated by its overexpression in human GBM specimens , which acts in an autocrine fashion to promote glioma cell dispersal through neuropilin-1 .
186						Silencing Sema3A expression by RNA interference resulted in a significant suppression in migration and an alteration in glioma cell morphology in a Rac1 dependent manner .
187						Nonetheless , it should be noted that Sema3A exhibits an antiangiogenic effect in meningiomas , as evident by the correlation of its high expression with reduced tumor vascularization .
188						Recurrence of meniginomas is often associated with a decline in Sema3A expression .
189	tissuelist:TS-0416	glioma cell	e56,c5	c5	Sema3A , in vitro data revealed that Sema3F inhibits glioma cell migration via RhoA inactivation by p190 RhoGAP .	In contrast to Sema3A , in vitro data revealed that Sema3F inhibits glioma cell migration via RhoA inactivation by p190 RhoGAP .
190						Frequent deletion of 3p21 in gliomas , where the Sema3F gene resides could abolish its effect in counteracting tumor cell motility .
191						In a related study , low level of Sema3F expression was observed in highly metastatic human tumor cell lines due to Id2 mediated repression of gene transcription , which possibly accounts for the enhancement of tumor cell migration and invasion .
192						Similarly , an overexpression of or an exogenous stimulation by Sema3G in human U251 glioma cells is sufficient to inhibit migration and invasion , suggesting a cell autonomous or paracrine mechanism .
193						Recently , Sema5A has been shown to suppress human glioma cell migration and invasion in a plexin-B3- and Rac1 dependent manner .
194						A downregulation of Sema5A protein is found from low- to high-grade gliomas .
195						Notably , stimulation of human glioblastoma cells with Sema5A promotes their differentiation from anaplastic to astrocytic morphology , which is reminiscent of the less pleomorphic and well differentiated features associated with low-grade astrocytomas .
196						Taken together , these findings suggest a tumor suppressor role of Sema5A , which is compromised towards high-grade glioblastomas .
197						In addition to semaphorins , there has been evidence pointing to the importance of neuropilins in glioma development .
198						Analyses of human glioma specimens revealed a significant correlation of Nrp-1 expression with glioma progression to high grades .
199						An upregulation of Nrp-1 in glioma cells was found to promote tumor growth and angiogenesis in vivo .
200						These effects are mediated through the promotion of c-Met phosphorylation , hence potentiating the autocrine HGF and c-Met signaling pathway .

202						Semaphorin and Plexin Signalings
203						Semaphorins and their receptors are inarguably involved in the progression of a large number of cancer types , with functions ranging from cell migration , invasion , metastasis , proliferation , and apoptosis , to angiogenesis .
204						It is not uncommon that many semaphorins can induce pro- and antitumorigenic effects in different cancers , making it a challenging task to decipher the underlying mechanisms of these activities .
205						For instance , Sema3B induces apoptosis in lung and breast cancer but is associated with poor prognosis and survival of glioma patients .
206						Sema3A promotes glioblastoma cell dispersal but inhibits angiogenesis in meningiomas .
207						Possible reasons for these diversities could be attributable to cross-interactions between different subfamilies of semaphorins and plexins , which show differential binding affinity and specificity , thereby triggering different sets of signaling events and functions .
208						A second level of regulation is attained by coupling plexins and and or neuropilins to various coreceptors expressed in a cell- or tissue specific manner , such as neuropilins , L1-cell adhesion molecule , c-Met proto-oncogene , the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 , and PDGFR .
209						This could potentially elicit a more diverse network of signaling events .

233						On the other hand , there is also opposing evidence that indicates the role of Sema4D in RhoA inactivation instead .

260						Coupling of Plexin-B with c-Met and ErbB2 as Coreceptors
261						c-Met is a tyrosine kinase receptor that upon stimulation by hepatocyte growth factor and scatter factor ( HGF and SF ) regulates various cellular functions such as cell proliferation , migration , invasion , and morphogenesis through activation of various signalings such as the Ras and the PI3K and AKT pathways .

266						By contrast , a recent study has reported the opposite in melanoma .
267						Sema4D fails to activate c-Met in melanomas , not because of a significant downregulation of plexin-B1 in these cancer cells .

270	tissuelist:TS-0614	melanoma cells	c15			Importantly , restoring plexin-B1 expression in melanoma cells is sufficient to suppress tumor growth in vivo , suggesting a tumor suppressor role of plexin-B1 .
271						In fact , the contrasting effects of semaphorins and plexins in regulating HGF and c-Met signaling is not unexpected given the ability of plexins to modulate Ras and PI3K as described above .

277						Notably , analysis of astrocytomas of different grades shows no gene amplification of ErbB2 .
278						The expression of ErbB2 protein is weaker than EGFR and is at barely detectable level by Western and immunocytochemistry analysis .

281						Regulation of Semaphorins and Plexins by Oncogenic Pathways
282						While semaphorins and plexins impose their pro- and antitumorigenic functions in gliomas through the regulation of various signaling pathways , accumulating evidence suggests that they are also targets for modulation by some of the aberrant oncogenic pathways .
283			e114	c17	The gene encoding for Sema3B for instance , was identified as a direct target of the tumor suppressor gene p5	The gene encoding for Sema3B for instance , was identified as a direct target of the tumor suppressor gene p53 that is commonly mutated in gliomas .
284	tissuelist:TS-0417	glioblastoma cell	c17			Ectopic expression of p53 in a p53 deficient glioblastoma cell line results in dramatic induction of Sema3B mRNA expression and a reduction in the number of colonies in anchorage independent growth assays .
285						These findings suggest that Sema3B mediates the tumor suppressor functions of p53 , which is often diminished in gliomas .
286						Hyperactivation of Ras and its downstream signaling cascades is another commonly observed genetic lesion in different cancers including gliomas .
287						Oncogenic mutations of B-Raf , one of the effectors of Ras is prevalent in melanomas and other cancers but is rarely detected in gliomas , which when present are mainly restricted to high-grade malignant glioblastomas .
288						In gliomas , gain in copy number is more common than mutations for Ras and Raf , though both forms of deregulation lead to activation of the MEK and ERK pathway .
289						Interestingly , constitutive B-Raf/MEK/ERK signaling was found to be associated with a downregulation of plexin-B1 transcript in melanoma .
290						Restoring plexin-B1 expression in melanoma cells is sufficient to suppress anchorage independent growth in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in xenograft transplants in nude mice .
291						The antitumorigenic effect of plexin-B1 is dependent on its R-RasGAP activity and is associated with AKT inactivation .
292						While R-Ras is less oncogenic than other Ras , its deregulation in gliomas is known to promote migration and invasion behaviors .
293						It is plausible that the antitumorigenic functions of plexin-B1 observed in melanoma are adopted in gliomas as well .

295						Concluding Remarks
296						Gliomas are known to exhibit not only histological heterogeneity but also variations in genetic alterations both inter- and intratumorally .
297						These have led to the proposition to incorporate molecular signature to classical histopathological diagnosis so as to provide a more informative description of the features of different glioma types .
298						Here , an overview of various signaling pathways commonly deregulated in gliomas was presented .
299						Despite our increasing knowledge of how these oncogenic pathways interact in a complex manner to contribute to aberrant cell proliferation , resistance to apoptotic cell death , enhanced migration and invasion , and induction of angiogenesis in glioma cells , the options of clinical treatment are still currently largely limited to a combination of surgical resection , followed by radiotherapy or chemotherapy using nonspecific alkylating agents such as temozolomide .
300						While a number of inhibitors and antibodies that suppress the activities of deregulated kinases such as EGFR , c-MET , PDGFR , and PI3K are currently in difference phases of preclinical characterizations or clinical trials , the outcomes show great variations and are complicated by toxicity associated with the agents .
301						The emerging roles of semaphorins and their receptors in the regulation of gliomagenesis and progression therefore represent potential novel candidate targets .
302						Given the engagement of plexins with some of the oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases such as c-Met and ErbB2 as coreceptors , a better understanding of the crosstalk between these signaling networks is required .
303						Supported by the recent success in detecting MGMT methylation level in glioblastoma patients to predict their sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy using alkylating agents , future direction in clinical management of gliomas , which are heterogeneous in nature , is to define the molecular and genetic profile of the tumor in individual patient so as to devise a customized regimen of treatments .

315						Signaling cascades mediated by plexin-A and plexin-B , and their crosstalk with oncogenic pathways in gliomas .
316						Plexin-As serve as coreceptors for neuropilins to transduce signals of class 3 semaphorins .
317						Fyn is activated upon semaphorin stimulation , which phosphorylates cyclin dependent kinase-5 ( Cdk5 ) and in turn collapse response mediator protein ( CRMP ) .
318						Cdk5 also phosphorylates isoform A of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase enhancer ( PIKE-A ) , which is a pro-oncogenic and antiapoptotic factor that activates AKT and promotes glioma cell growth , migration , and invasion .
319						Stimulation of plexin-B with semaphorins causes recruitment of active Rac1 to the Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding ( CRIB ) domain in the cytoplasmic tail , leading to sequestration of Rac1-GTP from its effector p21 activated kinase ( PAK ) and suppression of its downstream signalings .
320						Stimulation of plexin-B also promotes the recruitment of Rac1 to Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor ( RhoGDI ) alpha , which sequesters Rac1 and shuttles it from the membrane to the cytosol to prevent activation .
321						The PDZ domain binding motif at the C-terminus of plexin-B interacts with PDZ domain containing Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( PDZ-RhoGEF ) , which promotes RhoA activation .
322						RhoA-GTP can signal to Raf and activate the MAPK pathway .
323						The GTPase activating protein ( GAP ) domain in the cytoplasmic tail of plexin-A and -B is activated upon semaphorin stimulation and Rnd1 binding , leading to inactivation of R-Ras and PI3K signaling but derepression of PTEN activities .
