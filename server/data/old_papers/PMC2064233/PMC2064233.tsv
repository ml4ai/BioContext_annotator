1						Identification of Golgi localized acyl transferases that palmitoylate and regulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase
2						Lipid modifications mediate the subcellular localization and biological activity of many proteins , including endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) .
3			E1,E2	C1,S1		This enzyme resides on the cytoplasmic aspect of the Golgi apparatus and in caveolae and is dually acylated by both N myristoylation and S palmitoylation .
4						Palmitoylation deficient mutants of eNOS release less nitric oxide ( NO ) .
5						We identify enzymes that palmitoylate eNOS in vivo .
6	tissuelist:TS-0249	human embryonic kidney 293 cells	C1			Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the complementary DNA ( cDNA ) for eNOS and 23 cDNA clones encoding the Asp-His-His-Cys motif ( DHHC ) palmitoyl transferase family members showed that five clones ( 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 , and 21 ) enhanced incorporation of [ 3H ] - palmitate into eNOS .
7	taxonomy:9606	human	S1			Human endothelial cells express all five of these enzymes , which colocalize with eNOS in the Golgi and plasma membrane and interact with eNOS .
8			E3,E4	S1,C1		Importantly , inhibition of DHHC-21 palmitoyl transferase , but not DHHC-3 , in human endothelial cells reduces eNOS palmitoylation , eNOS targeting , and stimulated NO production .
9						Collectively , our data describe five new Golgi targeted DHHC enzymes in human endothelial cells and suggest a regulatory role of DHHC-21 in governing eNOS localization and function .
10						Introduction
11						The production of nitric oxide ( NO ) by the vascular endothelium is important for cardiovascular homeostasis , as endogenous NO regulates many fundamental cellular processes , including growth , mitochondrial respiration , differentiation , and migration .
12	tissuelist:TS-0278	endothelium	C2			Endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS or NOS3 ) synthesizes NO in the endothelium lining all blood vessels , and genetic deletion of eNOS causes many cardiovascular phenotypes , including increased blood pressure , impaired angiogenesis , abnormal vascular remodeling , and accelerated atherosclerosis .
13			E5,E6	C2	N myristoylation and S palmitoylation	eNOS is a peripheral membrane protein that is modified by dual acylation ( N myristoylation and S palmitoylation ) , which targets it to specific biological membranes .
14			E7,E8,E9,E10,E11,E12	C2		All dually acylated proteins , including eNOS , src family members , and certain G protein alpha subunits are cotranslationally N myristoylated on cytoplasmic ribosomes followed by posttranslational cysteine palmitoylation .
15			E13,E14	C2		eNOS is N myristoylated at glycine-2 and posttranslational S palmitoylated on cysteines 15 and 26 .
16						N myristoylation and S palmitoylation mediate localization of eNOS to the Golgi complex and cholesterol rich microdomains of the plasma membranes , including caveolae and lipid rafts .
17						Acylation defective mutants of eNOS that can not target either domain impair basal and agonist stimulated NO release .
18						Little is known about the enzymatic mechanisms for dual palmitoylation in mammalian cells .
19						This fatty acid modification is reversible , unlike N myristoylation , which is permanent .
20						In the context of eNOS , palmitate turnover is 45 min , whereas myristate turnover occurs with the protein backbone ( both ~ 20 h ; ) .
21						Palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of proteins may be regulated by extracellular signals , providing a mechanism for dynamic regulation of protein localization .
22						Recently , a new family of acyl transferase enzymes that catalyzed the protein palmitoylation was discovered .
23	taxonomy:4932	yeast	S2,E15,E16	S2		Genetic screens in yeast identified Erf2 and 4 and Akr1p as palmitoyl transferases for yeast Ras2 and casein kinase2 ( Yck2 ) .
24			E17,E18,E19	S2		Deletion of Erf2 and 4 or Ark1 reduces palmitoylation of Ras2 or Yck2 , respectively .
25						Erf2 and 4 or Ark1 share a common region , the Asp-His-His-Cys motif ( DHHC ) , within a cysteine rich domain ( CRD ) .
26						The DHHC and CRD domains are essential for palmitoyl acyl transferase ( PAT ) activity .
27	taxonomy:9606	human	S3,E20	S3		The human homologues of the yeast Erf2 and Erf4 complex are DHHC-9 and a Golgi localized protein designated GCP16 .
28						This complex has been shown to palmitoylate H- and N-Ras in vitro .
29						23 genes encoding proteins with DHHC-CRD domains have been identified in mouse and human databases .
30			E21	S3		Some of these proteins are known as Golgi specific DHHC zinc finger protein ( GODZ and DHHC -3 ; ) , the c-Abl-associated protein Abl-philin2 ( Aph2 and DHHC -16 ; ) , Sertoli cell DHHC protein ( SERZ-beta and DHHC -7 ; ) , Huntingtin interacting protein 14 ( HIP14 and DHHC -17 ; ) , and DHHC-15 , which palmitoylates the neuronal scaffold protein PSD-95 .
31						In the present work , we screened the 23 known DHHCs to examine which isoforms can palmitoylate eNOS .
32	taxonomy:9606,tissuelist:TS-0278	human, umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)	E22,E23,E24,E25,E26,S4,C4	S4,C4		We found that five mammalian DHHC proteins ( DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 ) palmitoylate eNOS , are present in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs ) , and colocalize with eNOS on the Golgi apparatus .
33			E27,E28	S4,C4		Finally , inhibition of DHHC-21 reduces eNOS palmitoylation , mislocalizes eNOS , and antagonizes NO release from endothelial cells .
34						Results
35						Identification of candidate eNOS PATs
36	tissuelist:TS-0249	human enbryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells	C5			Human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cells were cotransfected with each of the palmitoyl transferase cDNAs together with eNOS and the biosynthetic incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS examined by fluorography .
37			E29,E30,E31,E32,E33	C5		As shown in , only five clones ( DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 ) markedly enhanced incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS ( , top , see fold increase in label relative to total eNOS ) , defining them as putative eNOS PATs .
38						The incorporation of palmitate into thioester linkages is sensitive to the strong base hydroxylamine .
39			E34,E35	C5		As shown in , the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS is reduced by hydroxylamine , demonstrating that this occurs via a thioester linkage similar to the palmitoylation of PSD-95 by DHHC-3 , which was recently described .
40						In addition , mutation in the core DHHC domain of these enzymes ( mutation of DHHC to DHHS ) reduces the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS , consistent with previous reports .
41	uaz:UA-CT-30002,tissuelist:TS-0048,uaz:UA-CLine-7847,uaz:UA-CLine-7361,tissuelist:TS-0830	HUVECs, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), HEK 293, lung carcinoma (A549), prostate carcinoma cells (LnCAP)	C6,C7,C8,C9,C10			Next , we examined the expression of the five candidate eNOS PATs by RT-PCR in different human cell lines , including HUVECs , human aortic smooth muscle cells ( HASMCs ) , HEK 293 , lung carcinoma ( A549 ) , and prostate carcinoma cells ( LnCAP ) .
42						As shown in , all of tested DHHCs are expressed in the cell lines studied .
43						However , in HUVEC , the major cell type that expresses eNOS , DHHC-21 was the most highly expressed , followed by DHHC-2 and -3 .
44			E36	C6,C7,C8,C9,C10		Cysteines 15 and 26 have been identified as the major sites of palmitoylation of eNOS .
45			E37	C6,C7,C8,C9,C10		As displayed in , transfection of DHHC-21 , but not -11 ( as a control ) , increases the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS , an effect eliminated by mutation of cysteines 15 and 26 to serine ( C15 and 26S eNOS ) .
46						Figure 1 .
47						Screening for potential eNOS PATs .
48						( A ) Individual DHHC clones were cotransfected with eNOS into HEK 293 cells .
49						After metabolic labeling with 3 [ H ] - palmitic acid , proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE , followed by fluorography ( top ; 3 [ H ] - eNOS ) .
50						The same samples were analyzed by Western blotting ( bottom ; eNOS WB ) .
51						Note that several DHHC enzymes enhance the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitic acid into eNOS ( bold numbers ) .
52						The bottom blots depicts the level of the HA tagged DHHC .
53						( B ) Treatment with hydroxylamine ( NH2OH ) reduces 3 [ H ] - palmitate incorporation into eNOS after cotransfection of eNOS and several DHHC enzymes .
54						The NH2OH sensitivity of PSD-95 was used as control .
55						( C ) Mutagenesis of DHHC-3 and -7 abolishes the 3 [ H ] - palmitate incorporation into eNOS .
56						( D ) Total mRNA was isolated from different human cell lines , and the expression of DHHC isoforms was analyzed by RT-PCR .
57						( E ) The palmitoylation of WT eNOS by DHHC-21 is diminished by mutation of the two sites of eNOS palmitoylation , cysteines 15 and 26 .
58						DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 localize to the Golgi region and plasma membrane in a pattern similar to eNOS
59	uaz:UA-CLine-100020	COS-7	C11			We expressed the HA tagged DHHC proteins in COS-7 cells and localized them by immunofluorescence microscopy .
60						As shown in , DHHC-21 ( middle ) colocalized with the Golgi matrix protein GM-130 ( left ) , as did DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , and -8 .
61						Increasing the magnification of these images by 4x ( , bottom ) depicts clear colocalization of DHHC-21 with GM130 and a lesser amount of protein in the plasma membrane ( , arrows ) .
62						Next , we determined the proportional distribution of these enzymes in sodium carbonate using a discontinuous sucrose gradient .
63						In this method , tightly embedded membrane proteins are buoyant ( at the 5-30 % sucrose interface in fractions 2-4 ) , whereas soluble proteins remain at the bottom of the gradient ( in fractions 7-10 ) .
64						In all the gradients , the distribution of caveolin-1 , the coat protein of caveolae , and beta-COP , a marker of Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles were used to confirm adequate fractionation .
65						As shown in , the DHHCs and eNOS cofractionated into two pools , light membranes enriched in caveolin-1 and heavy membranes enriched in beta-COP and beta-actin ( not depicted ) .
66						Densitometric quantification ( , right ) of protein localization showed that a fraction of all DHHCs sediment as integral membrane proteins , with the greatest proportional amount for DHHC-2 and -21 .
67						Figure 2 .
68						DHHC-PATs colocalize with GM130 and eNOS and cosediment with eNOS .
69						( A ) COS-7 cells were transfected with HA tagged DHHC cDNAs .
70						After 48 h , cells were fixed , incubated with antibodies against GM-130 ( Golgi marker ; green ) and HA ( red ) , and mounted on glass slides with medium containing nuclear dye DAPI ( blue ) .
71						Merged images with DAPI are shown .
72						Bars , 10 mum .
73						( B ) COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding DHHC-HA enzymes and eNOS , and lysates were fractionated as described ( see Materials and methods ) .
74						Equal volumes of each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for eNOS , HA , caveolin-1 , and beta-COP .
75						Results are representative of two separate experiments that gave similar results .
76						Quantitative analysis shows that DHHC-2 and -21 are enriched in light membrane fractions .
77						In region of interest 1 , the arrow is pointing to Golgi localized DHHC-21 , whereas in region of interest 2 , the arrow is pointing to DHHC-21 in plasma membrane .
78						Colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation of DHHC enzymes with eNOS
79						Next , we examined colocalization of eNOS with DHHC enzymes by immunofluorescence microscopy in transfected cells .
80						COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the cDNAs for eNOS and HA tagged DHHC-21 and localized with antibodies against eNOS and the HA epitope .
81						As shown in , eNOS and DHHC-21 ( other DHHCs are shown in Fig .
82						S2 , available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200601051/DC1 ) colocalized in the Golgi region and to a lesser extent in plasma membrane .
83						Because palmitoylation is a cytoplasmic event and eNOS is a peripheral membrane protein , we determined whether DHHC enzymes and eNOS can interact .
84						As seen in ( left ) , the HA tagged DHHCs and eNOS were well expressed in total cell lysates prepared from the cells .
85						Immunoprecipitation of HA tagged DHHC enzymes using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody detected the coassociation with eNOS ( , right , third to seventh lanes ) with the DHHCs , whereas no immunoreactive protein was observed after immunoprecipitation of lysates from cells expressing eNOS alone ( , right , first lane ) .
86						Figure 3 .
87						DHHC-PATs colocalize with eNOS and interact in coprecipitation experiments .
88						( A ) COS-7 cells were transfected with eNOS and HA tagged DHHC-21 cDNAs .
89						After 48 h , cells were fixed , incubated with antibodies against eNOS ( green ) and HA ( red ) , and mounted on glass slides with medium containing nuclear dye DAPI ( blue ) .
90						Bars , 10 mum .
91						( B ) Coexpression of eNOS and DHHCs in COS-7 cell lysates ( left ) and the interaction between eNOS and the DHHC-HA after purification of the HA tagged DHHC ( right ) .
92						( C ) Coexpression of Golgi targeted eNOS ( S17 eNOS ) or plasma membrane targeted eNOS ( S25 eNOS ) and DHHCs in COS-7 cell lysates ( left ) and the coprecipitation of eNOS isoforms with DHHC-HA enzymes ( right ) .
93						( D ) WT and eNOS phosphomutants ( S1179A and S1179D eNOS ) and DHHC-PATs were coexpressed in COS-7 cells ( left ) , and the interaction between these proteins was studied after immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody ( right ) .
94						These experiments are representative of three separate experiments that gave similar results .
95						Previously , we targeted eNOS to the Golgi versus the plasma membrane using different domains of syntaxin-3 .
96						To determine the importance of localization on the interaction between eNOS and DHHC enzymes , we cotransfected Golgi targeted eNOS ( eNOS S17 ) or plasma membrane targeted eNOS ( eNOS S25 ) and DHHC-3 , -7 , and -21 .
97			E38	C11		As shown in , the interaction between the Golgi targeted eNOS and the DHHC enzymes was stronger than the plasma membrane targeted isoform , consistent with the majority of DHHCs and eNOS present on the Golgi of transfected cells .
98						Next , we assessed whether the phosphorylation state could affect the interaction of eNOS with DHHCs .
99						To address this question , DHHCs were cotransfected with wild-type ( WT ) eNOS and two eNOS phosphomutants , eNOS S1179A and S1179D .
100			E39,E40,E41,E42,E43,E44	C11		Serine 1179 is a key phosphorylation site for several kinases , including Akt , AMP kinase , and cAMP protein kinase , and phosphorylation of this site is associated with eNOS activation .
101						Mutation of S1179 to D renders eNOS constitutively active , whereas S1179 to A is less activated .
102						As seen in , in all cases , WT and phosphomutants were associated with DHHC enzymes , indicating that phosphorylation of this particular residue was not critical for the interaction of eNOS with DHHC-3 and -21 .
103			E45,E46,E47	C12		eNOS fatty acylation is required for an efficient interaction with DHHC proteins and NO release
104	uaz:UA-CLine-100020	COS cells	C12			To examine whether the localization of eNOS is important for the interaction of eNOS with DHHCs , COS cells were transfected with WT and different mutants of eNOS that influence eNOS acylation and targeting .
105						Cells were transfected with WT eNOS ( N myristoylated and S palmitoylated , Golgi , and plasmalemma targeted ) , G2A eNOS ( neither N myristoylated nor S palmitoylated and cytosolic ) , C15 and 26S eNOS ( N myristoylated but not S palmitoylated ; diffuse perinuclear localization ) , or L2S eNOS ( N myristoylated but not palmitoylated because of the mutation of the intervening leucines between the two palmitoylation sites , C15 and C26 ; diffuse perinuclear pattern ; , ; ) with DHHC-3-HA .
106						As shown in ( left ) , WT eNOS is primarily Golgi targeted and G2A eNOS is diffusely distributed throughout the cells , whereas the palmitoylation deficient mutants , C15 and 26S and L2S eNOS , were retained in the perinuclear region but are more diffusely distributed compared with WT eNOS .
107						WT eNOS clearly colocalized with HA tagged DHHC-3 , whereas G2A eNOS did not , and the palmitoylation mutants ( C15 and 26S and L2S eNOS ) had a partially overlapping perinuclear pattern .
108						Figure 4 .
109						eNOS palmitoylation state regulates the interaction of eNOS with DHHC-PATs and NO release .
110						( A ) Schematic illustration of eNOS constructs .
111						WT eNOS ( both myristoylated and palmitoylated ) , G2A eNOS ( neither myristoylated nor palmitoylated ) , and C15 and 26S and L2S eNOS ( myristoylated but not palmitoylated ) .
112						( B ) COS-7 cells were transfected with HA tagged DHHC and eNOS cDNAs .
113						After 48 h , cells were fixed , incubated with antibodies against eNOS ( green ) and HA ( red ) , and mounted on glass slides with medium containing nuclear dye DAPI ( blue ) .
114						Merged images with DAPI are shown .
115						Bars , 10 muM .
116						( C ) COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids encoding DHHC-3 ( top ) or -21 ( bottom ) and eNOS mutants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA monoclonal antibody and Western blotted for eNOS to determine relative coassociation with DHHC enzymes .
117						The left panels show expression of eNOS ( top ) and DHHC-PPATs ( bottom ) in total cell lysates , the middle panels show the quantitative recovery of the HA tagged DHHC , and the right panels show the specific coassociation of WT eNOS with DHHC-3 and -21 .
118						The Western blots are representative of two separate experiments that gave similar results .
119						NO release from COS-7 cells cotransfected with WT eNOS ( D ) , G2A eNOS ( E ) , C15 and C26 eNOS ( F ) , and DHHC ( D-F ) cDNAs .
120						The nitrite accumulation in the medium was quantified after 24 h. All of the data represent the mean + /- SEM in three separate experiments .
121						* , P < 0.05 compared with eNOS alone .
122						Next , we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to determine the role of acylation and subcellular localization on the coassociation of eNOS with DHHC .
123						The eNOS constructs and DHHC-3 or -21 were equally expressed based on Western blotting of the proteins in cell lysates ( , left ) , and immunoprecipitation of DHHC-3-HA resulted in ample recovery ( , middle ) of DHHC-3 and -21 .
124						Interestingly , immunoprecipitation of DHHC-3 and -21 resulted in the coassociation with WT eNOS but not with the other acylation defective eNOS mutants ( , right ) .
125						These results indicate that the fatty acylation and targeting are important for the interaction between eNOS and the DHHC-PATs .
126						Finally , we examined whether the DHHCs can influence eNOS function by measuring NO release ( as nitrite after 24 h of accumulation ) .
127	uaz:UA-CLine-100020	COS-7	C13,E48,E49,E50,E51	C13		Cotransfection of COS-7 cells with WT eNOS and DHHC-3 , -7 , and -21 increased the basal accumulation of NO2- into the media .
128						However , this effect was eliminated in cells cotransfected with acylation defective G2A or C15 and 26S eNOS .
129						Knock down of endogenous DHHC-21 , but not -3 , levels in endothelial cells impairs eNOS palmitoylation , cellular targeting , and NO release
130						Although several DHHC enzymes can palmitoylate eNOS , DHHC-21 mRNA was the most highly expressed in endothelial cells , and the protein localized on the Golgi and interacted with eNOS .
131	tissuelist:TS-0278	endothelial cells	E52,C14	C14		To determine the role of DHHC-21 in palmitoylating eNOS in endothelial cells , an RNAi approach was used .
132						As shown in , transfection of endothelial cells with DHHC-21 siRNA duplex RNAs ( at 12.5 nM ) reduced the expression of DHHC-21 ( via quantitative RT-PCR ) expression in a time dependent manner , with maximal reduction at 48 h , where nonsilencing RNA as a control was ineffective .
133						The reduction in DHHC-21 mRNA levels resulted in a marked diminution in the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS by ~ 60 % .
134						Because eNOS palmitoylation is crucial for the perinuclear targeting of eNOS onto the Golgi , we performed an immunofluorescence analysis of eNOS in DHHC-21-depleted endothelial cells .
135						As shown in ( middle ) , knock down of DHHC-21 resulted in a more diffuse , perinuclear pattern of eNOS immunoreactivity compared with cells treated with nonsilencing RNA ( left ) .
136						In addition , treatment of endothelial cells with 2-bromopalmitate , a substrate based inhibitor of palmitoylation , resulted in a similar but more extensive mislocalization of eNOS ( , right ) .
137						Figure 5 .
138						Depletion of DHHC-21 expression in endothelial cells reduces eNOS palmitoylation , localization , and NO release .
139						( A ) DHHC-21 siRNA down-regulates DHHC-21 mRNA expression .
140						EA.hy .926 cells were transfected with a control ( nonsilencing [ NS ] ) or DHHC-21 siRNA duplex .
141						The DHHC-21 expression at the indicated time points was determined by real-time PCR .
142						( B ) EA.hy .926 cells were transfected with a control ( nonsilencing ) or DHHC-21 siRNA , and cells were labeled with 3 [ H ] - palmitate for 4 h and eNOS immunoprecipitated .
143						The percentage of labeled eNOS and total eNOS from two experiments was then quantified .
144						( C ) EA.hy .926 cells were transfected with nonsilencing or DHHC-21 siRNA or treated with 100 muM 2-bromopalmitate , and cells were fixed and stained for eNOS ( green ) and nuclei ( DAPI ; blue ) and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy .
145						Arrows indicate a significant decrease in NO2- release after DHHC-21 knockdown .
146						Bars , 15 mum .
147						( D ) NO release from control EA.hy .926 cells or cells transfected with nonsilencing or DHHC-21 siRNAs .
148						The nitrite accumulation was quantified for 8 h ( basal ; left ) and after the stimulation with ionomycin ( middle ) or ATP ( right ) for 30 min .
149						( E ) DHHC-3 siRNA down-regulates DHHC-3 mRNA expression .
150						EA.hy .926 cells were transfected with a control ( nonsilencing ) or DHHC-3 siRNA duplex .
151						The DHHC-3 expression at the indicated time points was determined by real-time PCR .
152						( F ) NO release from control EA.hy .926 cells or cells transfected with nonsilencing or DHHC-3 siRNAs .
153						The nitrite accumulation was quantified for 8 h ( basal ) and after the stimulation with ATP for 30 min .
154						The data represent the mean + /- SEM of triplicate samples repeated in three separate experiments .
155						* , P < 0.05 compared with control .
156						We next examined the effect of DHHC-21 knockdown on basal and agonist stimulated NO release from endothelial cells .
157	tissuelist:TS-0278	endothelial cells	C15,E53,E54	C15		In endothelial cells , increases in cytoplasmic calcium activate calmodulin , which binds to the canonical CaM binding domain in eNOS and serves as an allosteric regulator of electron flux through eNOS , leading to a burst of NO release .
158						Reduction of DHHC-21 , but not treatment with nonsilencing RNA , caused a slight decrease the basal accumulation of NO2- into the media ( , left ) .
159			E55,E56,E57,E58	C15		More important , reduction in DHHC-21 reduced the release of NO2- stimulated by both ionomycin ( middle ) and ATP ( right ) , indicating the importance of eNOS palmitoylation via DHHC-21 for eNOS activation .
160						To examine the specificity of DHHC-21 knockdown on eNOS function , we also reduced the levels of DHHC-3 with RNAi .
161						As seen in , transfection of endothelial cells with DHHC-3 siRNA ( at 12.5 nM ) reduced the expression of DHHC-3 ( via quantitative RT-PCR ) expression where nonsilencing RNA as a control was ineffective .
162			E59	C15		However , under these conditions , basal and ATP stimulated NO2- was not affected .
163						Discussion
164						The most salient feature of this paper is the identification of five DHHC-PAT cDNAs that can palmitoylate the dually acylated , peripheral membrane protein eNOS in vivo .
165			E60,e61,e62,e63,e64	C16		DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 colocalize with GM-130 , a peripheral membrane protein of the Golgi in transfected cells , suggesting that palmitoylation can occur on the cytoplasmic aspect of the Golgi complex .
166						The aforementioned DHHC-PATs also colocalize and associate with eNOS , providing evidence for the compartmentalization of protein palmitoylation .
167	tissuelist:TS-0278	endothelial cells	C16			Most critical , reduction of DHHC-21 in endothelial cells diminishes eNOS palmitoylation , mislocalizes eNOS , and impairs agonist stimulated NO release .
168						Although cysteine palmitoylation has long been recognized as important for protein trafficking and function , enzymes responsible for this have been elusive .
169						Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast initially identified that two genes containing CRDs are essential for palmitoylation of Ras2 and casein kinase .
170						This led to the discovery of mammalian DHHC genes and identification of their specific substrates .
171						Out of the 23 independent mammalian genes encoding DHHC containing proteins , only a few enzyme substrates have been identified .
172						DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , and -15 can palmitoylate PSD-95 , DHHC-3 ( GODZ ; ) can palmitoylate the GABA-A receptor , DHHC-17 can palmitoylate several neuronal substrates , including SNAP-25 and PSD-95 , and DHHC-9 can palmitoylate H- and N-Ras .
173			E65,E66,E67,E68,E69	C6,C7,C8,C9,C10		In the present study , only DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 significantly increased the incorporation of palmitate into eNOS , suggesting some degree of substrate specificity of the DHHCs .
174						As DHHC-2 , -3 , and -7 can palmitoylate the nonmyristoylated proteins PSD95 and GalphaS , these candidates are less likely to be specific N-myristoyl-requiring PATs .
175						RNAi mediated knockdown of endogenous DHHC-21 in endothelial cells reduces the incorporation of 3 [ H ] - palmitate into eNOS , mislocalizes eNOS , and reduces agonist stimulated NO release , whereas knock down of DHHC-3 did not reduce NO release , suggesting that although at least five DHHCs can significantly palmitoylate eNOS in transfected cells , DHHC-21 may be a more specific eNOS PAT .
176						The reasons for the apparent specificity of DHHC-21 toward eNOS in endothelial cells are not known , but it may be due to the amount of DHHC-21 protein relative to other DHHCs expressed in endothelial cells or to the posttranslational modification of DHHCs that may determine its substrate specificity or regulate its activity in a cell specific context .
177						In addition , we can not rule the possibility that other DHHCs palmitoylate eNOS in endothelial cells , as a substantial knock down of DHHC-21 reduced palmitoylation by only 50 % and NO release by 70 % .
178						Additional experiments using isoform selective antibodies and recombinant DHHC proteins with various substrates will help deconvolve DHHC substrate specificity and kinetics in more detail .
179			E70,E71,E72,E73,E74	C6,C7,C8,C9,C10		Other interesting findings are that DHHC-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -21 all enhance the transfer of palmitate into eNOS and are strongly colocalized with GM130 , a Golgi matrix protein localized to the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi , consistent with our previous suggestion that the Golgi is the site for eNOS palmitoylation .
180						Palmitoylation of substrates on the Golgi would stabilize protein association via kinetic trapping and allow for protein localization either on the Golgi or movement to the plasma membrane , as recently confirmed for Ras .
181						Supporting this are data showing that DHHC-9 , an H- and N-Ras PAT , colocalizes and interacts with GCP16 , which is a Golgi localized cosubunit that appears necessary for DHHC-9 activity toward Ras and movement of Ras to the plasma membrane .
182						For most dually acylated proteins , N myristoylation is a cotranslational modification that favors posttranslational cysteine palmitoylation .
183						For eNOS , mutation of the palmitoylation sites does not affect N myristoylation but blocks tight perinuclear targeting and NO release from cells ( , , 1997 ) .
184			E75	C16		The mistargeting and dysfunction of these mutants may reflect a structural change or lack of palmitoylation ; however , our RNAi experiments , which show that reduction in DHHC-21 decreases eNOS palmitoylation and impairs targeting , indicate that palmitoylation of eNOS is crucial for proper targeting and function .
185						The discovery of DHHC-PATs in vascular cells represents a new , exciting area .
186						Many proteins involved in signal transduction are palmitoylated , and this fatty acid modification is often necessary for function .
187						Understanding the tissue and cellular distribution of DHHCs and their substrates is critical for identification of PAT inhibitors that may be therapeutically useful .
188						Our data showing that DHHC-21 is a major eNOS PAT suggests that antagonizing this enzyme may be useful for reducing NO dependent changes in vascular permeability and tumor angiogenesis .
