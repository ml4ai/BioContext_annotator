172						"finally , a intriguing point in this study be that the action of p110gamma on both the cpg delivery system and cytokine production be independent of its kinase activity ."
173						several kinase independent function of p110gamma have be report previously .
174	tissuelist:TS-20002	cardiomyocytes	"E93,C16"	C16	"protein complex contain p110gamma be know to activate phosphodiesterase ( pde3b ) in cardiomyocyte to degrade camp in a manner independent of its kinase activity , ."	"protein complex contain p110gamma be know to activate phosphodiesterase ( pde3b ) in cardiomyocyte to degrade camp in a manner independent of its kinase activity , ."
175			"E94,E95,E96"	C15	"since increase in the camp level result in augmentation of tlr mediate il-12 production , with a decrease in il-10 production , we have hypothesize that the increased il-10 production in the absence of p110gamma might be the result of elevated camp level"	"since increase in the camp level result in augmentation of tlr mediate il-12 production , with a decrease in il-10 production , we have hypothesize that the increased il-10 production in the absence of p110gamma might be the result of elevated camp level ."
176			"E97,E98,E99,E100,E101,E102"	C15	" some reagent know to increase camp , such as forskolin , prostaglandin e2 , 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin or dibutyryl camp in il-10 production ."	"to answer this question we test some reagent know to increase camp , such as forskolin , prostaglandin e2 , 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin or dibutyryl camp in il-10 production ."
177					although these reagent more or less enhance il-10 productio	"although these reagent more or less enhance il-10 production , the effect be not specific to cpg stimulation , but rather , be commonly observe in tlr stimulation ( datum not show ) ."
178						the other kinase independent function of p110gamma be report in vascular repair and platelet aggregation .
179						"in addition , wild-type or the kinase dead mutant of p110gamma can block the growth of human colon cancer cell ."
180						"although the mechanism of these kinase independent action of p110gamma remain to be clarify , a scaffolding role for p110gamma have be suggest ."
181						"p110gamma-/- mouse show severe defect in immune response , and be protect completely against systemic anaphylaxi - ."
182						"additionally , in model of rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , and atherosclerosis , loss of p110gamma activity result in protection against disease progression - ."
183						"since il-10 be a anti-inflammatory cytokine , the increased il-10 production in p110gamma deficient cell may contribute , at least in a part , to protection against excessive inflammation ."
184						"it be also likely that the increased il-10 and decrease il-12 production in p110gamma-/- macrophage might explain partly the development of colorectal carcinoma in p110gamma-/- mouse , because the il-12-mediated th1 response favor effective anti-tumor immune response ."
185						"although further study be need to confirm the in vivo effect of p110gamma on the translocation of cpg , we finding suggest that when p110gamma be consider as a drug target for immune disease , , , not only its lipid kinase function , but also its kinase independent function should be consider ."
