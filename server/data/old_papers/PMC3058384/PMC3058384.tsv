1						COT and map3k8 drive resistance to raf inhibition through map kinase pathway reactivation
2						oncogenic mutation in the serine and threonine kinase b-raf be find in 50-70 % of malignant melanoma .
3						pre-clinical study have demonstrate that the b rafv600e mutation predict a dependency on the mitogen activate protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling cascade in melanoma - -- a observation that have be validate by the success of raf and mek inhibitor in clinical trial - .
4						however , clinical response to target anticancer therapeutics be frequently confound by de novo or acquire resistance - .
5						identification of resistance mechanism in a manner that elucidate alternative ' druggable ' target may inform effective long-term treatment strategy .
6						here , we express ~ 600 kinase and kinase related open reading frame ( orf ) in parallel to functionally interrogate resistance to a selective raf kinase inhibitor .
7						we identify map3k8 ( COT and tpl2 ) as a mapk pathway agonist that drive resistance to raf inhibition in b-rafv600e cell line .
8						cot activate erk primarily through mek dependent mechanism that do not require raf signaling .
9			e1	c1		moreover , cot expression be associate with de novo resistance in b-rafv600e culture cell line and acquire resistance in melanoma cell and tissue obtain from relapse patient follow treatment with mek or raf inhibition .
10						we further identify combinatorial mapk pathway inhibition or targeting of cot kinase activity as possible therapeutic strategy for reduce mapk pathway activation in this setting .
11						together , these result provide new insight into resistance mechanism involve the mapk pathway and articulate a integrative approach through which high-throughput functional screen may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategy .
12	uaz:UA-CLine-5240	A375	c1,e2	c1		to identify kinase capable of circumvent raf inhibition , we assemble and stably express 597 sequence validate kinase orf clone represent ~ 75 % of annotated kinase ( Center for Cancer Systems Biology ( CCSB ) / Broad Institute kinase orf collection ) in a375 , a b-rafv600e malignant melanoma cell line that be sensitive to the raf kinase inhibitor plx4720 .
13						orf expressing cell treat with 1 microm plx4720 be screen for viability relative to untreated cell and normalize to a assay specific positive control , mek1s218 and 222d ( mek1dd ) .
14						nine orf confer resistance at level exceed two standard deviation from the mean and be select for follow-up analysis .
15						three of nine candidate orf be receptor tyrosine kinase , underscore the potential of this class of kinase to engage resistance pathway .
16						resistance effect be validate and prioritize across a multi-point plx4720 drug concentration scale in the b-rafv600e cell line a375 and skmel28 .
17						the Ser and Thr map kinase kinase kinase ( map3k ) map3k8 ( COT and tpl2 ) and raf1 ( c-raf ) emerge as top candidate from both cell line ; these orf shift the plx4720 gi50 by 10-600 fold without affect viability .
18						both COT and c-raf reduce sensitivity to plx4720 in multiple b-rafv600e cell line confirm the ability of these kinase to mediate resistance to raf inhibition .
19			e3	c2		next , we test whether overexpression of these gene be sufficient to activate the mapk pathway .
20						at baseline , cot expression increase erk phosphorylation in a manner comparable to mek1dd , consistent with map kinase pathway activation .
21			e4,e5	c2		overexpression of wild-type cot or c-raf result in constitutive phosphorylation of erk and mek in the presence of plx4720 , whereas kinase-dead derivative have no effect .
22						base on these result , we hypothesize that COT and c-raf drive resistance to raf inhibition predominantly through re-activation of mapk signaling .
23			e6	c2		notably , of the nine candidate orf from we initial screen , a subset ( 3 ) do not show persistent erk and mek phosphorylation follow raf inhibition , suggest mapk pathway independent alteration of drug sensitivity .
24			e7	c2		several group have show that c-raf activation and heterodimerization with b-raf constitute critical component of the cellular response to b-raf inhibition - .
25	uaz:UA-CLine-5240	A375	c2,e8	c2		in a375 cell , endogenous c-raf : b-raf heterodimer be measurable and inducible follow treatment with plx4720 .
26				c2		however , endogenous c-raf phosphorylation at s338 -- a event require for c-raf activation -- remain low .
27			e10,e11	c2		in contrast , ectopically express c-raf be phosphorylate on s338 and its plx4720 resistance phenotype be associate with sustained mek and erk activation .
28						moreover , ectopic expression of a high activity c-raf truncation mutant ( c-raf ( w22 ) be more effective than wild-type c-raf in mediate plx4720 resistance and erk activation , further indicate that elevated c-raf activity may direct resistance to this agent .
29	uaz:UA-CLine-5240	A375	c3,e12	c3		consistent with this model , oncogenic allele of nra and KRAS confer plx4720 resistance in a375 cell and yield sustained c-raf ( s338 ) and erk phosphorylation in the context of drug treatment .
30						thus , although genetic alteration that engender c-raf activation ( e.g. , oncogenic ra mutation ) tend to show mutual exclusivity with b rafv600e mutation , such co-occurring event , might be favor in the context of acquire resistance to b-raf inhibition .
31						to investigate the role of COT in melanoma , we first determine its expression in human melanocyte .
32			e13	c4		we find that primary immortalize melanocyte ( b-raf wild-type ) express COT , although ectopic b-rafv600e expression reduce COT mrna level and render COT protein undetectable .
33	uaz:UA-CLine-5240	A375	c4			conversely , whereas ectopically express COT be only weakly detectable in a375 cell , shrna mediate depletion of endogenous b-rafv600e cause a increase in COT protein level that correlate with the extent of b-raf knockdown .
34	uaz:UA-CLine-5240	A375	c5,e14	c5		moreover , treatment of COT express a375 cell with plx4720 lead to a dose dependent increase in COT protein without affect ectopic cot mrna level .
35						thus , oncogenic b-raf may antagonize cot expression largely through altered protein stability , and b-raf inhibition may potentiate the outgrowth of COT express cell during the course of treatment .
36			e15,e16	c5		notably , neither c-raf nor b-raf alone or in combination be require for erk phosphorylation in the context of cot expression , even in the presence of plx4720 , suggest that cot expression be sufficient to induce map kinase pathway activation in a raf independent manner .
37						we predict that cell line express elevated COT in a b-rafv600e background should exhibit de novo resistance to plx4720 treatment .
38						to identify such instance , we screen a panel of cell line for evidence of map3k8 and cot copy number gain coincident with the b rafv600e mutation .
39						of 534 cell line that have undergo copy number analysis and mutation profiling , 38 cell line ( 7.1 % ) contain the b rafv600e mutation .
40	uaz:UA-CLine-100098,uaz:UA-CLine-4664	OUMS-23,RPMI-7951	c6,c7			within this subgroup , two cell line -- oums-23 ( colon cancer ) and rpmi-7951 ( melanoma ) -- also show evidence of chromosomal copy gain span the map3k8 and cot locus and robust cot protein expression .
41	uaz:UA-CLine-100096	M307	c8,e17	c8		we also screen a panel of melanoma short-term culture for COT protein expression .
42						only one of these line express COT : m307 , a short-term culture derive from a b-rafv600e tumor that develop resistance to allosteric mek inhibition follow initial disease stabilization .
43			e18	c6,c7,c8		all three cell line be refractory to plx4720 treatment , exhibit gi50 value in the range of 8-10 microm and show sustained erk phosphorylation in the context of b-raf inhibition .
44	uaz:UA-CLine-100098,uaz:UA-CLine-4664	OUMS-23,RPMI-7951	e19,c9,c10	c9,c10		OUMS-23 and rpmi-7951 be mapk pathway inhibitor-naive cell line , imply that COT may confer de novo resistance to raf inhibition ( a phenomenon observe in ~ 10 % of b-rafv600e melanoma ) .
45	taxonomy:9606	patients	s1			next , we examine cot expression in the context of resistance to the clinical raf inhibitor plx4032 by obtain biopsy material from 3 patient with metastatic , b-rafv600e melanoma .
46						"each case consist of frozen , lesion match biopsy material obtain prior to and during treatment ( "" pre-treatment "" and "" on-treatment "" ; , ) ; additionally , one sample contain two independent biopsy specimen from the same relapsing tumor site ( "" post-relapse "" ; ) ."
47			e20	s1		consistent with the experimental model present above , quantitative real-time rt-pcr ( qrt and pcr ) analysis reveal increase COT mrna expression concurrent with plx4032 treatment in 2 of 3 case .
48						cot mrna level be further increase in a relapse specimen relative to its pre-treatment and on-treatment counterpart ( , patient # 1 ) .
49						a additional , unmatched relapse malignant melanoma biopsy show elevated COT mrna expression comparable to level observe in raf inhibitor resistant , COT amplify cell line .
50			e21,e22,e23,e24	s1		this specimen also exhibit robust mapk pathway activation and elevated expression of b-raf , c-raf and cot relative to match normal skin or b-rafv600e cell line .
51						sequencing study of this tumor reveal no additional mutation in braf , nra or KRAS ( datum not show ) .
52						these analysis provide clinical evidence that cot dependent mechanism may be operant in at least some plx4032 resistant malignant melanoma .
53	uaz:UA-CLine-4664	RPMI-7951	e25,c11	c11		to determine if COT might actively regulate mek and erk phosphorylation in b-rafv600e cell that harbor naturally elevated cot expression , we introduce shrna construct target COT into rpmi-7951 cell .
54			e26	c11		depletion of COT suppress rpmi-7951 viability and decrease erk phosphorylation , imply that target cot kinase activity might suppress mek and erk phosphorylation in cancer cell with cot overexpression or amplification .
55	uaz:UA-CLine-4664	RPMI-7951	c12,e27,e28	c12		treatment of rpmi-7951 cell with a small molecule cot kinase inhibitor - result in dose dependent suppression of mek and erk phosphorylation , provide additional evidence that COT contribute to mek and erk activation in these cell .
56						we then consider whether COT express cancer cell remain sensitive to mapk pathway inhibition at a target downstream of COT or RAF .
57	uaz:UA-CLine-100098,uaz:UA-CLine-4664	OUMS-23,RPMI-7951	c13,c14			here , we query the oums-23 and rpmi-7951 cell line for sensitivity to the mek1 and 2 inhibitor ci-1040 .
58			e30	c13,c14		interestingly , both cell line be refractory to mek inhibition and display sustained erk phosphorylation even at 1 microm ci-1040 .
59						ectopic cot expression in a375 and skmel28 cell also confer decrease sensitivity to the mek inhibitor ci-1040 and azd6244 , suggest that cot expression alone be sufficient to induce this phenotype .
60	uaz:UA-CLine-5240	A375	e31,c15	c15		similar to result observe with pharmacological mek inhibitor , mek1 and 2 knockdown only modestly suppress cot mediate erk phosphorylation in a375 cell .
61			e32	c15		in accordance with prior observation , these datum raise the possibility that COT may activate erk through mek independent and mek dependent mechanism .
62						to test this hypothesis directly , we perform a in vitro kinase assay use recombinant COT and erk1 .
63			e33,e34	c15		indeed , recombinant COT induce pthr202 and tyr204 phosphorylation of erk1 in vitro suggest that in certain context , cot expression may potentiate erk activation in a mek independent manner .
64						in experimental model , the use of raf and mek inhibitor in combination can override resistance to single-agent .
65						we therefore reason that combine raf and mek inhibition might circumvent COT driven resistance .
66						in the setting of ectopic cot expression , exposure to azd6244 or ci-1040 in combination with plx470 ( 1 microm each ) reduce cell growth and perk expression more effectively than do single-agent plx4720 , even at concentration of 10 microm .
67						these datum underscore the importance of this pathway in b-rafv600e tumor cell and support earlier finding that dual b-raf and mek inhibition may help circumvent resistance to raf inhibitor .
68						b raf mutation be find in ~ 8 % of all cancer and at high frequency in malignant melanoma , colon and thyroid cancer .
69						the clinical promise of selective raf inhibitor have widespread ramification for patient treatment , yet single agent target therapy be almost invariably follow by relapse due to acquire drug resistance .
70						we result suggest that orf base , systematic functional screening may offer a powerful means to identify clinically relevant resistance mechanism that also specify novel treatment strategy .
71						in particular , resistance to raf inhibition can be achieve by multiple map3k dependent mechanism of mek and erk reactivation but might be intercept through combine therapeutic modality for mapk pathway inhibition ( e.g. , raf and mek or raf and cot combination ) .
72						future systematic drug resistance study may be expand to a genome scale that encompass many compound , thereby enable comprehensive identification of both therapy specific resistance gene and drug target of novel therapeutics .
