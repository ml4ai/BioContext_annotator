Receptor regulated class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases ( PI3K ) phosphorylate the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) -4,5 - P 2 to PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 .
3						This , in turn , recruits and activates cytosolic effectors with PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 -binding pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains , thereby controlling important cellular functions such as proliferation , survival , or chemotaxis .

Using GFP tagged PI3Kgamma subunits expressed in HEK cells , we show that Gbetagamma recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its p101 subunit .
7					Gbetagamma recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its p101 subunit .	Accordingly , p101 was found to be required for G protein mediated activation of PI3Kgamma in living cells , as assessed by use of GFP tagged PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 -binding PH domains .
8					Gbetagamma recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its p101 subunit .	Furthermore , membrane targeted p110gamma displayed basal enzymatic activity , but was further stimulated by Gbetagamma , even in the absence of p101 .
9					Gbetagamma recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its p101 subunit .	Therefore , we conclude that in vivo , Gbetagamma activates PI3Kgamma by a mechanism assigning specific roles for both PI3Kgamma subunits , i.e. , membrane recruitment is mediated via the noncatalytic p101 subunit , and direct stimulation of Gbetagamma with p110gamma contributes to activation of PI3Kgamma .
10						Introduction
11						Phosphoinositide 3-kinases ( PI3Ks ) phosphorylate the D3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides , thereby generating intracellular signaling molecules .
12						These phospholipids , i.e. , phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) -3 - P , PtdIns-3 ,4 - P 2 , and PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 , have been implicated in cellular functions including chemotaxis , differentiation , glucose homeostasis , proliferation , survival , and trafficking .
13						They transmit signals by recruiting effector molecules that possess specific lipid binding domains .
14						FYVE domains and PX domains bind to PtdIns-3-P with high affinity , whereas a subgroup of pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains , containing a highly basic motif , preferentially binds PtdIns-3 ,4 - P 2 and PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 .
15						PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 represents the major product of class I PI3Ks in vivo .
16						These lipid kinases are under tight control of cell surface receptors , including receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) or G protein coupled receptors ( GPCR ; ) .
17						All class I members are heterodimers consisting of a p110 catalytic and a p85- or p101-type noncatalytic subunit .
18						The class I A p110 isoforms alpha , beta , and delta form a complex with p85 adaptor subunits , whereas the only class I B member ( p110gamma ) is associated with a p101 noncatalytic subunit .
19						The p85 subunit binds to tyrosine phosphorylated RTKs .
20						This interaction has two consequences resulting in activation of the PI3K .
21						First , the cytosolic enzyme translocates to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane , giving p110 access to its lipid substrate .
22						Second , the interaction with the tyrosine phosphorylated receptor induces a conformational change of p85 that results in disinhibition of p110 enzymatic activity .
23						Because the p85 regulatory subunit inhibits the p110 catalytic subunit , it is feasible that constitutively membrane associated class I A p110 mutants trigger downstream responses characteristic of growth factor action .
24						Similar to class I A PI3Ks , unstimulated PI3Kgamma is predominantly localized in the cytosol , whereas GPCRs induced an increase of PI3Kgamma in the membrane fraction .
25						GPCRs activate PI3Kgamma through direct interaction with Gbetagamma , whereas a stimulation by Galpha is quantitatively less important .
26						However , little is known about the activating mechanism , e.g. , it remains elusive whether Gbetagamma functions as a membrane anchor or an allosteric regulator of PI3Kgamma .
27						Although the p101 subunit has been proposed to act as an indispensable adaptor linking Gbetagamma with p110gamma , in vitro studies have suggested that p101 is not mandatory for Gbetagamma induced stimulation of PI3Kgamma .
28						Moreover , a direct interaction of Gbetagamma with NH 2 - and COOH-terminal regions of p110gamma has been demonstrated .
29						Further support for a direct interaction of Gbetagamma with the p110 catalytic subunit came from the observation that the p110beta isoform can also be stimulated by Gbetagamma , regardless of whether p85 is present or not .
30						Nevertheless , the noncatalytic p101 subunit of PI3Kgamma binds tightly to Gbetagamma , suggesting specific roles in G protein induced regulation of this lipid kinase .
31						For instance , in vitro studies showed that Gbetagamma stimulated p110gamma potently produced PtdIns-3-P , whereas the Gbetagamma activated heterodimeric p110gamma and p101 counterpart potently catalyzed the formation of PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 .
32						This suggests that p101 may affect the interaction of Gbetagamma stimulated p110gamma with the lipid interface .
33						Therefore , the exact roles of Gbetagamma and PI3Kgamma subunits in G protein induced activation of PI3Kgamma in living cells remain unclear .
34						Hence , we asked whether Gbetagamma functions as a membrane anchor and and or allosteric activator , and whether p101 is required for proper function of p110gamma in vivo .
35						To tackle these questions , we examined cellular events leading to activation of PI3Kgamma using fluorescent fusion proteins in living cells .
36						Results
37						Characterization of fluorescent PI3K fusion proteins
38						To visualize PI3Kgamma subunits in vivo , we generated constructs encoding p110gamma and p101 fused to YFP or CFP ( A ) .
39						Their expression in human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) 293 cells was verified by immunoblot analysis using an antibody against GFP ( B ) .
40						The catalytic activity and Gbetagamma sensitivity of PI3Kgamma fusion proteins was confirmed by in vitro lipid kinase assays after immunoprecipitation with an mAb recognizing only intact p110gamma ( C ) .
41						Precipitates from vector transfected control cells neither exhibited p110gamma immunoreactivity nor lipid kinase activity .
42						These results demonstrate that YFP fused p110gamma or p101 retain essential functions of the wild-type PI3Kgamma .
43						Figure 1 .
44						Construction and characterization of fluorescent PI3Kgamma fusion proteins .
45						( A ) Schematic representation of the wild-type , fluorescent , and membrane targeted PI3Kgamma subunits .
46						A YFP ( or CFP ) tag was fused to either the NH 2 - or the COOH terminus of p110gamma and p101 .
47						The p110gamma-CAAX fusion protein contains an isoprenylation motif ( bars for lipid modifications ) .
48						( B ) Differently fluorescence tagged PI3Kgamma subunits were coexpressed in HEK cells , and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with a GFP specific antibody .
49						( C ) Catalytic activity of fluorescent PI3Kgamma fusion proteins .
50						HEK cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids .
51						Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation ( IP ) with ( + ) or without ( - ) an anti-p110gamma antibody .
52						immunoprecipitation was controlled by immunoblotting ( IB ) with another anti-p110gamma antibody .
53						Shown are chemiluminescence images ( top panels ) .
54						Immunoprecipitates were assayed for in vitro PI3K activity in the absence or presence of 120 nM Gbetagamma using PtdIns-4 ,5 - P 2 - containing lipid vesicles and gamma [ 32 P ] ATP as substrates .
55						Depicted are autoradiographs of the generated 32 P-PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 ( bottom panels ) .
56						Subcellular distribution of PI3Kgamma subunits and instability of monomeric p101
57						Next , we examined the subcellular distribution of the YFP tagged PI3Kgamma subunits in living cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy .
58						Although YFP was uniformly distributed inside HEK cells ( unpublished data ) , fluorescence signals from YFP fused to the NH 2 or COOH termini of p110gamma were only detected in the cytosolic compartment ( A , top ) .
59						However , a small fraction of the YFP fused p110gamma was also detected in the nucleus when coexpressed with wild-type p101 ( B , top ) .
60						The same distribution was seen for YFP tagged p101 coexpressed with wild-type p110gamma ( B , bottom ) .
61						Thus , fluorescent PI3Kgamma subunits form heterodimers ( see next section ) , present in the cytosol and nucleus of HEK cells , whereas distribution of the p110gamma subunit alone seems restricted to the cytosol .
62						Interestingly , YFP fused p101 alone showed a predominant nuclear localization with a significantly lower overall fluorescence intensity ( A , bottom ) .
63						Figure 2 .
64						Expression and subcellular distribution of fluorescent p110gamma and p101 in HEK cells .
65						( A ) Cells were transfected with plasmids for YFP tagged single PI3Kgamma subunits as indicated .
66						Images were taken by confocal laser scanning microscopy .
67						Images of typical cells are shown .
68						White bars indicate a 10-mum scale .
69						( B ) Cells were cotransfected with both p110gamma and p101 .
70						Only one subunit was fused to YFP as indicated .
71						( C ) Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding fluorescent p110gamma and p101 at different ratios .
72						The total amount of transfected cDNA was kept constant by the addition of pcDNA3 .
73						Equal amounts of whole-cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody .
74	uaz:UA-CLine-7847	HEK cells	c2			To explore the possibility that expression levels of p101 could depend on the coexpression of p110gamma , we transfected HEK cells with different ratios of plasmids encoding fluorescent p110gamma or p101 and analyzed total cell lysates by immunoblotting using an anti-GFP antibody ( C ) .
75						The expression level of p110gamma correlated with the amount of the p110gamma ( but not the p101 ) plasmid .
76						In contrast , the expression level of p101 was also dependent on the amount of the p110gamma plasmid .
77						Hence , the stability of p101 depends on the coexpression of p110gamma , but not vice versa .
78						The poor cytosolic fluorescence of YFP tagged p101 in the absence of p110gamma may thus be explained by cytosolic degradation of monomeric p101 .
79						In vivo dimerization of PI3Kgamma subunits
80						To directly demonstrate heterodimerization of PI3Kgamma subunits in living cells , we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) .
81						FRET between two fluorophores , e.g. , CFP and YFP , is restricted to distances of < 100 A , and therefore , provides direct evidence for a protein protein interaction .
82						We coexpressed CFP- and YFP tagged PI3Kgamma subunits and determined FRET by following the donor ( CFP ) recovery during acceptor ( YFP ) bleach ( A ) .
83						All combinations showed significant FRET , although quantitative differences were evident .
84						Figure 3 .
85						Dimerization of p110gamma and p101 .
86						( A ) HEK cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding NH 2 - or COOH-terminally YFP tagged p110gamma and NH 2 - or COOH-terminally CFP tagged p101 in different combinations .
87						FRET was measured in vivo .
88						An increase in CFP ( donor ) fluorescence during YFP ( acceptor ) bleach indicates FRET between fluorescent PI3Kgamma subunits .
89						The depicted data represent means + /- SEM of at least 18 single cells in three independent transfection experiments .
90						( B ) HEK cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids .
91						Cytosols were prepared and subjected to gel filtration .
92						The elution profiles were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-GFP antibody ( L , load diluted 1:5 ; V , void volume ; 20-26 , fraction numbers ) .
93						Because FRET efficiency is a function of the distance between two fluorophores , quantitative differences may represent different distances of the fluorescent tags fused to the NH 2 or COOH termini of p101 and p110gamma in a particular combination .
94						However , the different FRET efficiencies may also reflect different degrees of heterodimerization .
95			e8	c2	 p101 and p110gamma combinations	To exclude the latter , we analyzed heterodimerization of different p101 and p110gamma combinations by size-exclusion chromatography ( B ) .
96						The elution profile of YFP-p110gamma ( B , bottom ) was completely shifted to earlier fractions on coexpression with CFP-p101 ( B , top ) , indicating a high degree of heterodimerization .
97						A similar elution profile was found for p110gamma-YFP + CFP-p101 ( B , middle ) , albeit a lower FRET efficiency was detected for this combination .
98			e9	c2	p101 and p110gamma heterodime	Hence , the different FRET efficiencies observed are not due to different degrees of dimerization , but likely reflect different distances of the fluorescent tags in the p101 and p110gamma heterodimer .
99						Thus , their two NH 2 termini as well as their two COOH termini are in close proximity , whereas the NH 2 terminus of each subunit is relatively far from the COOH terminus of the other .

In the case of PI3Kgamma , the major stimulus is assumed to be Gbetagamma , which is membrane bound and has been shown to directly bind to both kinase subunits under in vitro conditions .
103						Therefore , we asked whether overexpression of free Gbetagamma directs YFP fused PI3Kgamma subunits to the cell membrane in vivo .
104						Surprisingly , p110gamma was not membrane localized in the presence of coexpressed Gbetagamma in HEK cells ( A , top ) .
105			e15	c2	Gbetagamma recruited p101 to the membrane , resulting in accumulation of NH 2 - or COOH-terminally YFP tagged p101 at both plasma- and endomembranes ( A , bottom , and B ) .

119						HEK cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding PI3Kgamma , Gbetagamma , or both together .
120						To avoid rounding and detachment of the cells , the kinase deficient mutant YFP-p110gamma-K833R was used .
121						Membrane fractions were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p110gamma and anti-Gbeta antibodies .
122			e17	c3	p110gamma and p101 heterodimers	Next , we examined the subcellular localization of p110gamma and p101 heterodimers in the presence of free Gbetagamma .
123	uaz:UA-CLine-7847	HEK cells	c3			When coexpressed with p101 and Gbetagamma , the p110gamma fluorescent signal was at , or close to , plasma and endosomal membranes of HEK cells ( C , top ) .
124						The same picture emerged when the YFP-tag was fused to p101 ( unpublished data ) .
125						Correspondingly , CFP tagged Gbeta 1 coexpressed with Ggamma 2 exhibited a similar subcellular distribution like fluorescent heterodimeric PI3Kgamma ( compare C and 4 D ) , and immunoblotting of membrane derived proteins confirmed an enrichment of PI3Kgamma in the membrane compartment after overexpression of Gbetagamma ( E ) .
126			e18	c3	Gbetagamma directs cytosolic PI3Kgamma to the membrane via interaction with p101 .	Together , these data imply that Gbetagamma directs cytosolic PI3Kgamma to the membrane via interaction with p101 .
127						Interestingly , coexpression of heterodimeric PI3Kgamma together with Gbetagamma produced a rounded morphology and detachment of the cells ( C ) .
128			e19	c3	PI3K inhibitor wortmannin	This morphological change was reversed by treatment with 100 nM of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin in approximately half of the cells within 30 min , and not seen when a kinase deficient YFP-p110gamma-K833R mutant was used ( C ) .

144						HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the PH domain of GRP1 fused to GFP ( GFP-GRP1 PH ) , and the human fMLP receptor ( fMLP-R ) , p110gamma , and p101 in different combinations .
145						The localization of the GFP-GRP1 PH was monitored before and after the addition of 1 muM fMLP and 100 ng and ml EGF ( added 8 min later ) by confocal laser scanning microscopy .
146						Pictures were taken 4 min after addition of either agonist .
147						Images of typical experiments are shown ( white bars , 10 mum ) .
148						( C ) Membrane recruitment of the PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 -binding PH domain of Btk .
149						Instead of GFP-GRP1 PH , the PH domain of Btk fused to CFP ( Btk PH -CFP ) was used as a PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 sensor .
150						To measure PI3Kgamma activity by a complementary experimental approach , the effects of fMLP receptor stimulation on the subcellular distribution of GFP-GRP1 PH fusion proteins were examined .

153			e29,e30	c4	In cells coexpressing the fMLP receptor and heterodimeric PI3Kgamma , fMLP stimulation induced a rapid membrane translocation of GFP-GRP1 PH ( B , third panel ) , indicating that this effect indeed reflects fMLP receptor mediated stimulation of PI3Kgamma .	In cells coexpressing the fMLP receptor and heterodimeric PI3Kgamma , fMLP stimulation induced a rapid membrane translocation of GFP-GRP1 PH ( B , third panel ) , indicating that this effect indeed reflects fMLP receptor mediated stimulation of PI3Kgamma .
154						Accordingly , the fMLP induced effect was sensitive to pretreatment with pertussis toxin ( PTX ; unpublished data ) .
155						Interestingly , a slight basal membrane localization of GFP-GRP1 PH was visible in the cells coexpressing heterodimeric PI3Kgamma and the fMLP receptor even in the absence of agonist ( B , third panel ) .
156						Because this was not seen after PTX treatment ( unpublished data ) or in cells omitting the receptor ( B , second panel ) , it most likely reflected a constitutively active fMLP receptor .
157			e31	c4	 Akt phosphorylation 	Translocation of an isolated PH domain in single cells may be a more sensitive read-out for PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 production than the Akt phosphorylation assay .
158			e32	c4	 requirement of p101 for receptor induced PI3Kgamma activation ( A ) .	Hence , we used the GFP-GRP1 PH translocation approach to reexamine the requirement of p101 for receptor induced PI3Kgamma activation ( A ) .
159						Nevertheless , an fMLP induced membrane recruitment of GFP-GRP1 PH in cells coexpressing the receptor and p110gamma ( but not p101 ) was not visible ( B , fourth panel ) .
160						This finding confirms that the noncatalytic p101 subunit is required for GPCR mediated stimulation of PI3Kgamma in living cells .
161						To further strengthen the findings , we replaced GFP-GRP1 PH by the GFP fused PH domain of Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( Btk PH ) , which has also been described to bind PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 with high specificity and affinity .
162						As expected , fluorescent Btk PH was distributed equally between cytosol and nucleus in HEK cells ( C ) .
163						However , cells coexpressing the receptor and both PI3Kgamma subunits exhibited a slight basal membrane localization of Btk PH -CFP followed by a prominent translocation from the cytosol to the membrane on exposure to fMLP .
164						Similar to GFP-GRP1 PH , no fMLP induced redistribution of Btk PH -CFP was seen in the absence of p101 .

168						So far , these experiments did not clarify whether membrane recruitment itself is sufficient for activation of the enzyme or whether additional allosteric stimulation is required .
169						To tackle this question , we generated p110gamma mutants containing a COOH-terminal isoprenylation signal , i.e. , a CAAX-box motif , which constitutively localizes p110gamma to the plasma membrane .

181						A slight basal membrane localization of the fluorescent PH domain was evident on coexpression with p110gamma-CAAX ( A , top panel ) indicating an elevated PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 level .
182						The same picture emerged when p101 was present in the panel of transfected plasmids ( A , second panel ) .
183						On coexpression of the receptor , fMLP induced a significant additional translocation of GFP-GRP1 PH from the cytosol to the membrane ( A , third and fourth panel ) indicating additional stimulation of the membrane bound lipid kinase .
184						Interestingly , the effect was similar irrespective of whether p101 was present or not , suggesting direct activation of monomeric p110gamma .

186			e40,e41	c5	Because Gbetagamma can activate Ras , which in turn may activate p110gamma	Because Gbetagamma can activate Ras , which in turn may activate p110gamma , one may imagine that fMLP induced , p101 independent stimulation of p110gamma-CAAX was mediated by Ras .
187						However , coexpression of dominant negative Ras N17 had no effect on fMLP induced p110gamma-CAAX stimulation , whereas its inhibitory effect was evident when EGF induced MAP kinase activation was assessed ( A , bottom panel ) .
188						In addition , an indirect autocrine stimulatory effect was excluded because supernatants of fMLP stimulated cells failed to induce GFP-GRP1 PH translocation in cells omitting fMLP receptors ( unpublished data ) .

212						Discussion
213						PI3Kgamma is a key player in the regulation of leukocyte functions such as chemotaxis and superoxide production .
214						To elucidate the mechanism of how Gbetagamma activates the enzyme in vivo , we studied the subcellular localization and translocation of GFP tagged PI3Kgamma subunits and PH domains in living cells .
215						A p110gamma-GFP construct has been previously reported , but data describing a functional interaction of the fusion protein with G proteins are not available .
216						Therefore , we systematically tagged each PI3Kgamma subunit and found heterodimerization , enzymatic activity , and Gbetagamma-sensitivity of the fusion proteins unaffected by the tags , whereas a GFP tagged Gbeta complexed to Ggamma did not interact with PI3Kgamma ( unpublished data ) .
217						In resting cells , fluorescent PI3Kgamma was predominantly detected in the cytosol .
218						This resembles the native situation in which the vast majority of the endogenous PI3Kgamma pool has been assigned to the cytosol .
219						Thus , the GFP tagged proteins are appropriate tools to study the cellular events leading to activation of PI3Kgamma .
220						Recent analysis of p110gamma crystals gave insights into the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic PI3Kgamma subunit .
221						However , the structure of p101 and the molecular determinants for the interaction of both PI3Kgamma subunits are currently unknown .
222						In vitro data derived from p101 and p110gamma deletion mutants suggest that large areas of p101 may interact with the NH 2 -terminal side of p110gamma .
223						FRET data presented here indicate that NH 2 and both COOH termini of p110gamma and p101 are in close proximity .
224						The latter finding is of interest because the p110gamma COOH terminus harbors the catalytic domain .
225						Previous data have implied that not only Ras , but also Gbetagamma directly interact with the COOH terminus of p110gamma .
226						Therefore , interaction of p101 with the catalytic domain of p110gamma would be in line with the functional data suggesting that p101 affects interaction of Gbetagamma stimulated p110gamma with the lipid interface .
227						Gbetagamma is considered to be the principal , direct stimulus of GPCR induced PI3Kgamma enzymatic activity .
228						Convincing evidence for this assumption has come from reconstitution of purified proteins , demonstrating that in vitro , the enzymatic activity of heterodimeric and monomeric PI3Kgamma is significantly stimulated by Gbetagamma .
229						However , when we challenged the concept in living cells , marked differences in the sensitivities between heterodimeric and monomeric PI3Kgamma emerged .
230			e45	c7	The G protein coupled fMLP receptor activated p110gamma and p101	The G protein coupled fMLP receptor activated p110gamma and p101 , but not p110gamma , as evident from the translocation of fluorescent PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 sensors or the stimulation of Akt phosphorylation .
231	uaz:UA-CLine-7847	HEK cells	c7			Likewise , coexpressed Gbetagamma recruited p110gamma and p101 , but not p110gamma , to membranes of HEK cells .
232						Interestingly , PI3Kbeta , another Gbetagamma regulated PI3K , did not translocate to the membrane on GPCRs or Gbetagamma stimulation , whereas RTKs induced membrane recruitment in vivo ( unpublished data ) .
233						Does membrane recruitment of PI3Kgamma by itself result in constitutive activation of p110gamma ?
234						To answer this intriguing question , we used an isoprenylated mutant of p110gamma , i.e. , p110gamma-CAAX , which is permanently attached to the membrane , and thereby , is in close proximity to its lipid substrates .
235	uaz:UA-CLine-7847,uaz:UA-ORG-1094	hek cells, vsm cells	c8,c9			Expression of p110gamma-CAAX only slightly enhanced membrane association of fluorescent PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 sensors in HEK or VSM cells .
236						Notably , it did not affect the morphology of HEK cells .
237						In contrast , coexpression of Gbetagamma together with p110gamma-CAAX induced morphological changes comparable to cells transfected with plasmids encoding Gbetagamma and p110gamma and p101 .
238			e46	c8,c9	fMLP stimulated Akt phosphorylation	Furthermore , stimulation of the cells with fMLP stimulated Akt phosphorylation and membrane recruitment of PH domains regardless of whether p110gamma and p101 or p110gamma-CAAX was the effector .
239						This establishes a second role for Gbetagamma , i.e. , the activation of the membrane attached catalytic p110gamma subunit even in the absence of p101 .
240			e47	c8,c9	Gbetagamma interacts with either monomeric PI3Kgamma subunit through individual binding sites 	Although Gbetagamma interacts with either monomeric PI3Kgamma subunit through individual binding sites , it does not exclude the possibility that heterodimeric PI3Kgamma forms either a common or different binding site ( s ) for Gbetagamma .
241						Attempts to determine the stoichiometry of the interaction between heterodimeric PI3Kgamma and one or more Gbetagamma were inconclusive .
242						One possible reason may be a weak affinity between p110gamma and Gbetagamma , whereas p101 binds at least with moderate affinity to Gbetagamma as determined by copurification studies and by a Biacore plasmon resonance approach ( unpublished data ) .
243						Figure 9 .
244						Hypothetical model for receptor- induced membrane recruitment and activation of heterodimeric PI3Kgamma .
245						fMLP receptor , a prototypical heptahelical receptor coupled to G i proteins .
246						PI3Kgamma ; the cytosolic enzyme consists of a noncatalytic p101 subunit , which is in a tight complex with p110gamma , thereby stabilizing p101 .
247						The NH 2 and COOH termini of p101 and p110gamma are oriented in close proximity , respectively .
248						Contact sites involve the NH 2 termini of both subunits .
249						The modular domain structure of p110gamma ( RBD , Ras binding domain ; C2 , C2 domain ; hel , helical domain ; N-cat , C-cat , NH 2 - and COOH-terminal lobes of the catalytic domain ) is based on the crystal structure of an NH 2 -terminally truncated p110gamma .
250						( A ) Membrane recruitment .
251						The agonist stimulated receptor induces the release of Gbetagamma from G i proteins ( dotted arrow ) .
252						Gbetagamma recruits the PI3Kgamma heterodimer to the plasma membrane ( dotted arrow ) by binding to the noncatalytic p101 ( hollow arrow ) .
253						Accordingly , Gbetagamma and p101 function as a membrane anchor and an adaptor for PI3Kgamma , respectively .
254						In addition , the C2 domain of p110gamma may facilitate membrane attachment through interaction with phospholipids .
255						p101 may also affect the interaction of PI3Kgamma with the lipid interface .
256						Membrane attached PI3Kgamma exhibits basal enzymatic activity .
257						( B ) Allosteric activation .
258						At the membrane , Gbetagamma activates PI3Kgamma by direct interaction with p110gamma ( hollow arrows ) .
259						This stimulation does not require p101 .
260						However , p101 may participate in Gbetagamma induced stimulation of membrane attached p110gamma .
261						The stoichiometry of the Gbetagamma-PI3Kgamma interaction is unknown , i.e. , Gbetagamma may interact with p101 and p110gamma through individual or common binding sites .
262						Gbetagamma binds to the NH 2 - and COOH-terminal part of p110gamma , the latter harboring the catalytic domain .
263						Thus , Gbetagamma may allosterically activate PI3Kgamma through a conformational change in the catalytic domain .
264						Accordingly , Gbetagamma significantly increases V max of PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 production .
265						PtdIns-3 ,4,5 - P 3 , in turn , recruits PH domain containing effectors such as GRP1 or Btk to the plasma membrane ( dotted arrow ) .
266						In our paper , we present evidence that p110gamma is stable as a monomer without p101 , but not vice versa .
267						This may explain why relevant amounts of native monomeric p101 do not occur in vivo ( Wetzker , R. , personal communication ) .
268						p110gamma can be expressed as a stable protein independent of the presence of p101 , as shown previously ( C ; , ; ; ) .
269			e48	c8,c9	the p110 subunit of class I A PI3Ks needs stabilization by forming a complex with the p85 adaptor .	Interestingly , the p110 subunit of class I A PI3Ks needs stabilization by forming a complex with the p85 adaptor .
270						Accordingly , class I A p110alpha , beta , delta subunits are thought to occur only in their adaptor bound form .
271						Moreover , the p85 adaptor is more abundant than the p110 counterparts .
272						In contrast , p110gamma is also suggested to occur in the absence of p101 .
273						Increasing evidences suggest that monomeric p110gamma may also function as a downstream regulator of GPCR dependent signal transduction pathways in cells .
274						However , under in vivo conditions the p101 subunit seems mandatory for G protein mediated activation of PI3Kgamma by mediating membrane recruitment .
275						Therefore , the question arises of how monomeric p110gamma translocates to the membrane .
276						In this context , recent in vitro evidence points to the possibility that membrane attachment of p110gamma may involve binding to anionic phospholipids .
277						In line with this finding , the majority of PI3Kgamma is already associated with lipid vesicles in the absence of Gbetagamma under in vitro conditions , and vesicle bound PI3Kgamma can still be activated by Gbetagamma .
278						Alternatively , p110gamma may be recruited by binding to membrane anchored proteins other than Gbetagamma .
279						In this respect , p110gamma , like all other class I PI3Ks , is directly activated by GTP bound Ras .
280			e49	c8,c9	Gbetagamma may stimulate PI3Kgamma 	In conclusion , we present in vivo evidence that Gbetagamma may stimulate PI3Kgamma in a dual and complementary way , i.e. , by recruitment to the membrane , and by activation of the membrane bound enzyme .
281						In this scenario , the p101 subunit functions as an adaptor molecule necessary to recruit the catalytic subunit to the plasma membrane through high affinity interaction with Gbetagamma .
282			e50	c8,c9	direct interaction between Gbetagamma and the membrane attached catalytic p110gamma subunit contributes to a final activation of the enzyme by a mechanism other than translocation .	In turn , direct interaction between Gbetagamma and the membrane attached catalytic p110gamma subunit contributes to a final activation of the enzyme by a mechanism other than translocation .
