1						Persistent DNA damage signaling triggers senescence associated inflammatory cytokine secretion
2						Cellular senescence suppresses cancer by stably arresting the proliferation of damaged cells .
3						Paradoxically , senescent cells also secrete factors that alter tissue microenvironments .
4						The pathways regulating this secretion are unknown .
5						We show that damaged human cells develop persistent chromatin lesions bearing hallmarks of DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) , which initiate increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) .
6						Cytokine secretion occurred only after establishment of persistent DNA damage signaling , usually associated with senescence , not after transient DNA damage responses ( DDR ) .
7						Initiation and maintenance of this cytokine response required the DDR proteins ATM , NBS1 and CHK2 , but not the cell cycle arrest enforcers p53 and pRb .
8						ATM was also essential for IL-6 secretion during oncogene induced senescence and by damaged cells that bypass senescence .
9						Further , DDR activity and IL-6 were elevated in human cancers , and ATM-depletion suppressed the ability of senescent cells to stimulate IL-6-dependent cancer cell invasiveness .
10						Thus , in addition to orchestrating cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair , a novel and important role of the DDR is to allow damaged cells to communicate their compromised state to the surrounding tissue .
11						Cellular senescence limits the proliferation of damaged cells that are at risk for neoplastic transformation by imposing an essentially irreversible growth arrest .
12						Senescent cells also develop a complex senescence associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) , in culture and in vivo - .
13						The SASP can disrupt normal mammary differentiation , , promote endothelial cell invasion , and stimulate cancer cell growth and invasion in culture and tumor growth in vivo - .
14						Additionally , some SASP factors can reinforce the senescence arrest by autocrine or paracrine mechanisms - .
15						Among the SASP factors , IL-6 and IL-8 are of particular interest .
16						These cytokines initiate inflammatory responses , such as those associated with normal healing in damaged tissues , as well as many age related pathologies , including cancer .
17						Normal cells undergo senescence in response to severe or irreparable DNA damage , especially DNA DSBs .
18						Among the first proteins to respond to DSBs is ATM ( Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated ) , a member of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase like kinase ( PIKK ) family .
19					ATM substrates include H2AX , a nucleosomal histone variant , and p53 binding protein-1 ( 53BP1 ) , which facilitates checkpoint activation and repair .

21			e3,e4	c1,c2,c3	ATM also phosphorylates the DDR kinase CHK2 ( checkpoint kinase-2 )	ATM also phosphorylates the DDR kinase CHK2 ( checkpoint kinase-2 ) , which promotes growth arrest ; NBS1 ( Nijmegen breakage syndrome ) , a member of the MRN ( MRE11-RAD51-NBS1 ) complex that reinforces the DDR and participates in DNA repair ; and p53 , a tumor suppressor and transcriptional regulator that orchestrates repair and cell cycle arrest ( reviewed in ) .
22						DSBs that can not be repaired ( e.g. , uncapped telomeres ) cause constitutive DDR signaling , prolonged p53 dependent growth arrest , and eventually an essentially irreversible senescence arrest , .
23						Despite understanding much about how the senescence arrest is initiated and maintained , little is known about how the SASP is regulated .
24						We recently showed that the SASP is correlated with genotoxic stress , suggesting it is controlled by DDR signaling .
25						However , p53 , a key DDR effector , was not required for the SASP , raising the possibility that the SASP and DDR are not linked .
26						Here , we asked whether DDR components upstream of p53 regulate the SASP , focusing on two principal SASP factors , the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 .
27	uaz:UA-CLine-100115	hca2	c1			We synchronously damaged DNA in HCA2 human diploid fibroblasts using ionizing radiation ( X-ray ) .
28						A relatively low dose ( 0.5 Gy ) rapidly induced multiple 53BP1 foci in all nuclei and engaged the DDR , as indicated by p53 serine15 phosphorylation and upregulation of p21 , a cell cycle inhibitor and p53 target .
29						Both indicators returned to near-baseline levels within 10 h , as cells resolved the 53BP1 foci and resumed growth .
30						A senescence inducing dose ( 10 Gy ) also triggered a rapid DDR ; however , several 53BP1 foci failed to resolve , and increased in size .
31						These persistent DNA damage foci ( PDDF ) contained gammaH2AX , and remained for days and months ( not shown ) , while cells remained arrested .
32			e9	c1	( phosphorylated ) ATM	PDDF also contained activated ( phosphorylated ) ATM and ATM and ATR substrates .
33						Therefore , low dose radiation induced a transient DDR , from which cells recovered , whereas a high dose generated PDDF , localized but constitutive DDR signaling , and senescence .
34						Low dose radiation did not increase IL-6 secretion , which remained at control levels .
35						A high dose , in contrast , increased IL-6 and IL-8 secretion 5- to 6-fold within 2-4 d , and to replicatively senescent levels within 3-5 d .
36	uaz:UA-CLine-888	WI-38	c2			Human WI-38 fibroblasts behaved similarly ( not shown ) .
37						Thus , DNA damage and the DDR alone do not induce inflammatory cytokine secretion ; rather , secretion develops , after a delay , when the damage is sufficient to generate PDDF and persistent DDR signaling .
38						To test this idea further , we used lentiviruses to express p16 INK4a , a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that causes a senescence arrest .
39						The infected cells displayed few PDDF and secreted little IL-6 , yet expressed other senescence markers , including increased intracellular reactive oxygen species .
40						Conversely , > 2 PDDF and high IL-6 secretion was evident in cells induced to senesce by conditions that caused DNA damage .
41						IL-8 secretion behaved similarly .
42						HCA2 fibroblasts undergo p53 dependent replicative senescence owing to short ( dysfunctional ) telomeres , .
43						Accordingly , early passage cells had few PDDF , while senescent cells had three or more ( p < 10 -9 , two tailed student T-test for unpaired samples , ) .
44						As the cells proliferated , PDDF accumulated gradually ( , top ) , DNA synthesis declined , and IL-6 ( , bottom ) and IL-8 secretion increased .
45						IMR-90 human fibroblasts behaved similarly .
46						We used immunostaining to assess cytokine expression , growth arrest ( absence of DNA synthesis ) and PDDF in single cells within senescing HCA2 populations .
47						Proliferating cells can acquire dysfunctional telomeres prior to arresting growth .
48						Indeed , PDDF positive cells did not necessarily fail to synthesize DNA , although they synthesized DNA less frequently than cells without PDDF .
49	uaz:UA-CLine-7214	IMR90	c3			IMR90 fibroblasts behaved similarly .
50						Further , in late passage populations , many cells that synthesized DNA also showed robust immunostaining for IL-6 and MMP3 , another SASP factor .
51						Together with the p16 INK4a results , these findings suggest that PDDF , rather than the senescence arrest per se , correlate with inflammatory cytokine secretion .
52						To corroborate this idea , we suppressed telomeric PDDF in early passage HCA2 cells by expressing telomerase ( catalytic subunit , hTERT ) for 20 population doublings ( PDs ) .
53						In contrast to control cells ( ; compare PD25-40 to PD40-60 ) , hTERT expressing cells displayed slightly decreased PDDF but no increase in IL-6 secretion .
54						Moreover , when hTERT expressing cells exceeded the PD level at which unmodified cells completely senesce ( PD71-75 ) , PDDF and IL-6 secretion were similar to , or lower than , early passage cells .
55						To confirm that rescued telomere dysfunction , rather than hTERT per se , caused the decline in PDDF and IL-6 secretion , we induced senescence in PD50 hTERT expressing cells by X irradiation .
56						Radiation generated PDDF and greatly increased IL-6 secretion in these cells .
57						Thus , hTERT reduced telomeric PDDF , but not radiation induced PPDF ( most of which are presumably non telomeric ) .
58						These results strengthen the idea that PDDF and persistent DDR signaling are responsible for inflammatory cytokine secretion .
59	uaz:UA-CLine-100115	hca2	e10,e11,e12,c4	c4	 GSE22 ( a dominant peptide suppressor of p53 activity ) or SV-40 T antigen ( SV40LT , which inactivates p53 and pRb )	To determine whether the tumor suppressors p53 and pRb were required for IL-6 secretion , we used lentiviruses to express either a short-hairpin RNA against p53 ( shp53 ) , GSE22 ( a dominant peptide suppressor of p53 activity ) or SV-40 T antigen ( SV40LT , which inactivates p53 and pRb ) in replicatively senescent HCA2 cells .
60						As expected for HCA2 , which express low levels of endogenous p16 INK4a , p53 inactivation reversed the senescence growth arrest and drove cells into crisis ( ; not shown ) .
61						3-4 PDs after infection , IL-6 secretion did not decline , but rather increased .
62						Thus , neither p53 , pRB nor the senescence arrest was required for IL-6 secretion .
63						Likewise , we inactivated p53 ( see ) in early passage HCA2 cells using retrovirally delivered GSE22 .
64						There was no change in either PDDF or IL-6 secretion after 5 PDs .
65						However , 15 PDs after p53 inactivation , both IL-6 secretion and PDDF increased markedly .
66						These increases also occurred following p53 depletion by shp53 , although they were more modest ( perhaps owing to residual p53 levels ; ) .
67						Thus , p53 was not required to initiate PDDF driven cytokine secretion , and loss of p53 function in proliferating cells gradually increased the levels of both PDDF and secreted IL-6 .
68						To determine the contribution of telomeric PDDF to the increased IL-6 secretion by p53 deficient cells , we expressed hTERT in GSE expressing cells that had developed high levels of IL-6 secretion .
69						hTERT reduced both PDDF and IL-6 secretion , as it did for cells with wild-type p53 .
70						Cells expressing hTERT and GSE22 did not grow faster than cells expressing GSE22 only , ruling out the possibility that hTERT enabled the expansion of a few clones with serendipitously low PDDF and IL -6 secretion .
71						hTERT only partially reduced IL-6 and PDDF levels in p53 deficient cells , suggesting that dysfunctional or near-dysfunctional telomeres account for some , but not all , the PDDF in proliferating p53 deficient cells .
72						Nevertheless , even in actively dividing p53 deficient cells , reduced PDDF coincided with reduced IL-6 secretion .
73						ATM is a key responder to DNA damage and prominent component of PDDF .
74						We tested the idea that PDDF drive cytokine secretion by providing sustained DDR signaling .
75						We infected HCA2 cells with lentiviruses encoding shRNAs against GFP ( shGFP , control ) or ATM ( shATM ) .
76						ATM depletion ( 80-90 % ) prevented the increased IL-6 secretion that normally occurs 9-10 d following 10 Gy X irradiation .
77						We obtained similar results using WI-38 fibroblasts .
78						Additionally , ATM depletion in already ( replicatively ) senescent cells effectively abolished IL-6 secretion .
79						Finally , primary A-T fibroblasts , from patients carrying an inactivating mutation in ATM ( ataxia telangiectasia ) , had low but detectable basal IL-6 secretion levels and completely lacked the 2-3 d and 9-10 d cytokine responses following 10 Gy X irradiation .
80						ATM shares many substrates with ATR , another PIKK , which is preferentially activated when cells are damaged during S-phase .
81						To determine whether ATR was also important for the DNA damage cytokine response , we measured IL-6 secretion by primary fibroblasts from a Seckel syndrome patient .
82						These cells have almost undetectable ATR levels owing to a splicing mutation .
83						They also had relatively high basal levels of IL-6 secretion , but , nonetheless , IL-6 secretion increased after X irradiation ( 10 Gy ) .
84						The magnitude of the increase was smaller than the extent to which IL-6 secretion increased in wild-type cells , possibly because IL-6 secretion is already high in these cells or because ATR partly contributes to the cytokine response .
85						Whatever the case , these findings support the idea that persistent DDR signaling drives IL-6 secretion , and that , while ATR might contribute to this response , ATM is essential .
86						To determine whether other DDR components were necessary for the DNA damage cytokine response , we depleted cells of either NBS1 , an MRN component required for optimal ATM activity , or CHK2 , another DDR kinase and downstream target of ATM .
87						Similar to the effects of ATM depletion , NBS1 or CHK2 depletion essentially prevented the increased IL-6 secretion following 10 Gy X irradiation and abolished the high IL-6 secretion by already senescent cells .
88						Thus , three major DDR components ( ATM , NBS1 and CHK2 ) are essential for both establishing and maintaining the cytokine response to DNA damage .
89						To identify which SASP components respond to DDR signaling , we used antibody arrays to interrogate 120 cytokines and other factors secreted by senescent HCA2 cells .
90						We focused on 16 factors that were significantly modulated by X irradiation , the majority being upregulated .
91						We compared the secretion levels of these 16 factors in control and ATM depleted cells induced to senesce by X irradiation ( 10 Gy ) .
92						ATM depletion reduced the secretion of 7 of these 16 SASP factors , reducing IL-6 secretion 50-fold and IL-8 secretion 10-fold .
93						Nine factors were unchanged by ATM depletion ( < = 1.4-fold the secretion level of non depleted cells ) .
94						Thus , ATM signaling does not regulate the entire SASP , but is required for a subset of SASP components , including the major inflammatory cytokines .
95						The SASP can promote cancer cell invasion , largely due to secreted IL-6 .
96						To determine the biological significance of the DDR dependent cytokine response , we used conditioned medium ( CM ) from control and senescent ( X irradiated ) ATM depleted cells in invasion assays .
97						As expected , human breast cancer cells ( T47D ) were stimulated to invade a basement membrane when exposed to CM from control senescent cells .
98						This stimulatory activity was deficient , however , in CM from ATM depleted senescent cells , but was largely restored by supplementing this CM with recombinant IL-6 .
99						Thus , DDR dependent SASP factors can have a significant biological consequence .
100						Persistent DDR signaling has been detected in vivo in premalignant and malignant lesions in human breast , lung , skin , bladder and colon , .
101						To model premalignant cells , we used p53 defective HCA2-GSE22 fibroblasts after they spontaneously developed PDDF and increased IL-6 secretion .
102						ATM depletion in these cells reduced IL-6 secretion by 70 % , supporting the idea that DDR signaling can drive inflammatory cytokine secretion during neoplastic transformation .
103						To determine whether IL-6 secretion and DDR signaling are linked in vivo , we used immunostaining to assess DDR and ATM activity and IL-6 expression in human breast cancer specimens .
104						Both phosphorylated ATM and ATR substrates and IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in invasive ductal carcinomas compared to normal human breast tissue .
105						Thus , DDR signaling and inflammatory cytokine secretion correlated in vivo .
106						Inflammatory cytokine secretion is also a feature of cells that senesce due to oncogene activation ( oncogene induced senescence ; OIS ) in culture , , , and of preneoplastic lesions in human colon , which presumably harbor activated oncogenes in vivo .
107						To determine whether DDR signaling is required for OIS induced IL-6 secretion , we used lentiviral vectors to simultaneously express oncogenic RAS and shATM in HCA2 cells .
108						ATM deficient cells undergo rapid replicative senescence but react to OIS depending on the oncogene and context - .
109						As previously observed , oncogenic RAS expressing fibroblasts underwent OIS regardless of their ATM status .
110						Additionally , the RAS expressing ATM deficient cells developed a typical OIS morphology ( enlargement , vacuolization ) and 53BP1 foci that lacked detectable activated ATM .
111						Oncogenic RAS also caused OIS and 53BP1 foci in primary A-T cells ( ; not shown ) .
112						Therefore , ATM depletion had no discernible effects on OIS phenotypes , including growth arrest and PDDF .
113						However , ATM depletion effectively prevented OIS driven IL-6 secretion in both A-T and HCA2 cells .
114						Thus , ATM controls IL-6 secretion caused by multiple forms of damage induced senescence , including OIS , which is known to occur in vivo ( reviewed in ) .
115						Our findings identify a novel response to persistent DNA damage - the secretion of factors that allow damaged cells to communicate with their microenvironment .
116						This response is associated with cellular senescence , but also occurs in damaged cycling cells that are near , or have bypassed , senescence .
117						Our results suggest a model in which mild genotoxic stress ( e.g. , 0.5 Gy X-ray , which generates ~ 17 DSBs and nucleus ) causes a DDR , damage foci , transient cell cycle arrest and repair , but does not induce inflammatory cytokine secretion .
118						More severe genotoxic stress ( e.g. , dysfunctional telomeres , 10 Gy X-ray ) produces PDDF and persistent DDR signaling , which establishes and maintains the p53 dependent senescence growth arrest .
119						After several days , this DDR signaling also initiates the p53 independent cytokine response via ATM , NBS1 and CHK2 .
120						p53 deficient cells can initiate the cytokine response in the absence of growth arrest .
121						By contrast , cells induced to senesce by p16 INK4a expression , but in the absence of DNA damage , do not initiate a cytokine response .
122						Thus , the DDR can independently control at least two important phenotypes : the p53 dependent growth arrest and senescence associated extracellular inflammatory signaling .
123						Our results suggest that functions previously attributed to growth arrested senescent cells , specifically their ability to perturb the local microenvironment , can be acquired by damaged cells , whether or not they are senescent or competent to proliferate .
124						DDR signaling drives only a subset of SASP factors , but those include the potent inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 .
125						IL-6 was particularly important for the ability of senescent cells to promote cancer cell invasion .
126						Hallmarks of persistent DNA damage are seen in pre-cancerous and malignant lesions , , which are presumed to harbor activated oncogenes , and in aging mammalian tissues , .
127						Our results suggest DDR signaling drives the inflammation that is also a hallmark of premalignant , malignant and aging tissues .
128						During aging , damaged cells might cause or contribute to tissue dysfunction , including dysfunctional stem cell niches .
129						In cancer , such cells might promote inflammation , angiogenesis or other phenotypes of cancer progression .
130						Why do damaged cells mount a cytokine response ?
131						One demonstrated possibility is to reinforce a growth arrest - .
132						Presenescent levels of cytokines receptors are apparently sufficient to contribute to the rapid DDR growth arrest .
133						However , early experiments showed that senescent cells do not secrete factors that strongly inhibit the growth of nearby presenescent cells .
134						Thus , cytokines might reinforce a senescence arrest only when cells are moderately damaged or near senescent .
135						The cytokine response might also act in a paracrine manner - to suppress or promote the proliferation of neighboring cells in damaged tissues , allowing damaged cells to communicate their compromised state to surrounding cells , and perhaps mobilize the immune system for their clearance .
136						In support of this idea , tumors induced to senesce by genetic manipulation or chemotherapy regress , with evidence of activated innate immune cells , and senescent cells in injured liver appear to limit fibrosis before being cleared by the immune system .
137						In this context , the delayed cytokine response to severe DNA damage could allow cells to attempt DNA repair before generating potent immune mobilizing signals .
