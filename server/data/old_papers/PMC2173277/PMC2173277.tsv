2						"integrin , matrix metalloprotease ( mmp ) , and the cytokine tgf-beta have each be implicate in homeostatic cell behavior such as cell growth and matrix remodeling ."
3						"tgf-beta exist mainly in a latent state , and a major point of homeostatic control be the activation of tgf-beta ."
4						"because the latent domain of tgf-beta1 possess a integrin binding motif ( rgd ) , integrin have the potential to sequester latent tgf-beta ( SLC ) to the cell surface where tgf-beta activation could be locally control ."
5						"here , we show that slc bind to alphavbeta8 , a integrin express by normal epithelial and neuronal cell in vivo ."
6						"this binding result in the membrane type 1 ( mt1 ) - mmp dependent release of active tgf-beta , which lead to autocrine and paracrine effect on cell growth and matrix production ."
7						these datum elucidate a novel mechanism of cellular homeostasis achieve through the coordination of the activity of member of three major gene family involve in cell-matrix interaction .
8						introduction
9						"cellular homeostasis be maintain in the organism through the correct response to extra - , intra - , and intercellular signal ."
10						"imbalance in these signal can result in disruption of cellular homeostasis , lead to change in cell mass and and or tissue organization ."
11						"the cellular homeostatic machinery consist of secrete , cell surface , and intracellular molecule that together maintain cellular differentiation and the balance between quiescence and entry into the cell cycle ."
12						homeostasis be regulate through the control of cell proliferation mediate through cell-extracellular matrix interaction in concert with growth promote and inhibitory cytokine .
13						a growth inhibitory cytokine of particular importance in tissue homeostasis be the multifunctional cytokine tgf-beta .
14						the important role of tgf-beta in homeostasis be illustrate by the fact that tgf-beta1-deficient mouse develop epithelial hyperplasia ( in addition to lethal multiorgan inflammation ) within week after birth .
15						"tgf-beta1 be normally maintain in a latent or inactive state by the noncovalent association of the bioactive peptide of tgf-beta1 with its nh2-terminal propeptide , latency associate peptide ( lap ) -beta1 ."
16						"therefore , normal tgf-beta function be think to be largely control by its activation from the latent state , a process that be not understand completely ."
17						"however , recent evidence suggest that cell surface molecule or secrete extracellular molecule can activate tgf-beta ."
18						"specifically , the integrin alphavbeta6 and the secrete extracellular matrix molecule thrombospondin ( tsp ) -1 have be implicate in activation of tgf-beta1 through nonproteolytic mechanism ."
19						"in addition , plasmin or the cell surface localization of matrix metalloprotease mmp-9 by cd44 have be propose to lead to activation of tgf-beta through proteolytic degradation of lap-beta1 and lap-beta2 , respectively ."
20						"although these mechanism may be important to activation of tgf-beta , particularly in response to injury or during neoplastic progression , they individually do not explain the activation of tgf-beta1 in normal tissue ."
21						"indeed , mouse deficient in tsp-1 , plasminogen , cd44 , or alphavbeta6 be all bear viable and be able to reproduce , in marked contrast to the uniform lethality of tgf-beta1-null mouse ."
22						"the propeptide of tgf-beta1 , lap-beta1 , contain a rgd motif that be recognize by a subset of integrin share in common the alphav integrin subunit ."
23						"thus , three of the five alphav integrin , alphavbeta1 , alphavbeta5 , and alphavbeta6 , have be show to bind to lap-beta1 , and of these only alphavbeta6 can mediate tgf-beta activation ."
24						"recently , evidence suggest that alphavbeta6 mediated activation of tgf-beta1 play a important role in response to injury ."
25						"of the two remain alphav integrin , alphavbeta3 do not bind to lap-beta1 or mediate activation of tgf-beta1 , and alphavbeta8 have not be investigate since , until recently , a system have not be available to study its function ."
26						"the alphavbeta8 integrin be of particular interest , since it have be identify recently as a epithelial growth inhibitory molecule ."
27						"alphavbeta8 be express in the normal human airway epithelium but be lose in its malignant counterpart , suggest a role in epithelial homeostasis ."
28						"furthermore , heterologous expression of alphavbeta8 inhibit lung carcinoma cell growth both in vivo and in vitro ."
29						"since alphavbeta8 and tgf-beta1 be coexpress in normal tissue , such as the human airway , we consider the possibility that alphavbeta8 may participate in the maintenance of airway homeostasis through activation of tgf-beta ."
30						"in this article , we demonstrate a novel mechanism of cell growth regulation mediate by activation of tgf-beta1 via the integrin alphavbeta8 ."
31						we show that alphavbeta8 can bind lap-beta1 and that the consequence of this interaction be activation of tgf-beta1 .
32						"this mechanism of activation of tgf-beta1 differ from other reported mechanism because it be regulate through the coordinated interaction of integrin , tgf-beta , and mmp on the cell surface ."
33						"furthermore , we show that when lung cancer cell be reconstitute with alphavbeta8 , which be normally present on the epithelial cell from which they be derive , growth be now inhibit by tgf-beta1 ."
34						these datum provide novel insight into the mechanism underlie cellular homeostasis .
35						result
36						the integrin alphavbeta8 bind with high affinity to the rgd site of recombinant lap-beta1
37						"to determine if alphavbeta8 can bind to the rgd contain lap-beta1 , we perform affinity chromatography use surface radiolabele alphavbeta8 and immobilize lap-beta1 ."
38						"two band of the appropriate kd for the alphav and beta8 subunit ( 150 and 90 kd , respectively ) bind to immobilize lap-beta1 in a divalent cation dependent fashion as show by elution with edta ( a , lane 4-8 ) ."
39						"this binding be also dependent on the rgd sequence of lap-beta1 as demonstrate by the inability of rge ( a , lane 1 ' -3 ' ) and the ability of rgd to elute alphavbeta8 ( a , lane 4 ' -7 ' ) ."
40						the identity of the alphav and beta8 subunit in the elution fraction be confirm by immunoprecipitation ( b ) .
41						"anti-beta8 antibody immunoprecipitate 150- and 90-kd band from the rgd and edta elution fraction , which comigrate exactly with the two band immunoprecipitate with anti-alphav and anti-beta8 antibody from cell lysate ( b , rgd , edta , and lysate ) ."
42						"immunoprecipitation of the elution fraction use antibody to the other rgd binding integrin present on ht1080 cell , namely alphavbeta5 and alpha5beta1 , fail to detect any protein ( unpublished datum ) ."
43						"to measure the relative ability of truncate alphavbeta8 to bind to lap-beta1 and vitronectin ( vn ) , the only other known ligand for alphavbeta8 , we develop solid phase binding assay for alphavbeta8-ligand interaction use alkaline phosphatase ( ap ) - tag alphavbeta8 ( ap-alphavbeta8 ) ."
44						the ability of ap-alphavbeta8 to bind to immobilize lap-beta1 be confirm by metabolic labeling and affinity chromatography ( c ) .
45						two band of the appropriate molecular weight for the truncated alphav ( 140 kd ) and beta8-ap ( 130 kd ) subunit be elute by rgd peptide ( c ) .
46						no other metabolically label protein from the cell supernatant be show to bind to lap-beta1 by this method ( c ) .
47						"in solid phase assay , considerably more ap-alphavbeta8 bind to well coat with lap-beta1 ( 10 mug and ml ) than to well coat with vn ( 100 mug and ml ) ."
48						ap-alphavbeta8 do not bind to a mutant form of lap ( lap [ rge ] ) with a single amino acid substitution in the integrin recognition sequence and be completely elute by either rgd ( 1 mg and ml ) or edta ( 10 mm ) ( unpublished datum ) .
49						"furthermore , alphavbeta8 binding be almost completely inhibit by the monoclonal antibody 37e1 , specific to beta8 ."
50						the affinity of ap-alphavbeta8 for lap-beta1-sepharose be determine by saturation binding experiment .
51						"ap-alphavbeta8 bind to lap-beta1 with high affinity ( kd 13 pm ) with binding saturation reach at ~ 50 % ligand occupancy ( e , bmax : 0.5 fm and 1 .0 fm lap-beta1 ) ."
52						"scatchard analysis reveal a single high affinity state of ap-alphavbeta8 , consistent with other report that secrete alphav integrin be express in a constitutively active affinity state ."
53						"in contrast to the high affinity of ap-alphavbeta8 for lap-beta1 , the affinity of ap-alphavbeta8 for VN , the only other known ligand for alphavbeta8 , be too low to be determine use this assay ( unpublished datum ) ."
54						"thus , alphavbeta8 bind preferentially to lap-beta1 with high affinity , and this binding be both rgd and divalent cation dependent ."

77						"to determine if alphavbeta8 express on the cell surface could bind latent tgf-beta ( SLC ) under physiologic condition , we perform cell adhesion assay use both slc and lap-beta1 as immobilize ligand ."
78						"beta8 express ht1080 cell bind significantly better to SLC than to lap-beta1 at the 1.0 and 2.5 mug and ml coating concentration , whereas mock transduce ht1080 cell do not bind at all ( f ) ."
79						the reason for the increase in the alphavbeta8 dependent cell adhesion to SLC compare with lap-beta1 be unclear .
80						"however , it be likely that the presence of the mature tgf-beta1 peptide in SLC result in conformational difference between SLC and lap-beta1 , which could affect either receptor binding , stability , or coating efficiency ."
81						"thus , we show that SLC be the first and only known ligand capable of support stable alphavbeta8 mediate adhesion , since VN , the only other known alphavbeta8 ligand , do not support stable alphavbeta8 mediate adhesion ."
82						the integrin alphavbeta8 mediate activation of SLC
83			e1	"c1,c2"		"to determine the functional consequence of lap-alphavbeta8 interaction , we assess the ability of alphavbeta8 to activate the endogenous slc present in coculture system ."

85						we find that the tmlc reporter cell system be a more specific bioassay system for tgf-beta activity than the hepg2- ( sbe ) 4-lux system and be therefore use for most of these study .
86						the tmlc system consist of mink lung epithelial cell stably transfect with a tgf-beta responsive fragment of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter drive the luciferase gene .
87						tmlc cell be highly responsive to tgf-beta and produce a very low background of tgf-beta activation .
88						tmlc cell can thus be use in coculture with other cell line or cell-free fraction to test for the presence of active tgf-beta use luminescence as a readout .
89						"in the ht1080 , sw480 , and h647 cell line , heterologous expression of beta8 have either no effect or a slight effect on the cell surface expression of the other integrin beta subunit know to interact with the rgd motif ."
90						the only significant difference be a reduction of surface expression of the beta5 subunit in beta8 transduce compare with mock transduce ht1080 and sw480 cell .
91						it be possible that these slight reduction in surface expression of alphavbeta5-_NN on beta8 express ht1080 and sw480 cell could potentially reduce the magnitude of the beta8 effect on adhesion to lap-beta1 or influence the activation of tgf-beta .
92						"however , this be unlikely , since the alphavbeta5 integrin bind very weakly and do not mediate adhesion to SLC ( f , mock ) ."

328						"however , this be unlikely because of the following : cell line express alphavbeta8 attach to lap-beta1 equally well whether or not they express mt1-mmp ( unpublished datum ) , suggest that coexpression of mt1-mmp do not modify the activity of alphavbeta8 ; ( b ) flow cytometry of h1264 cell overexpress both beta8 and mt1-mmp use two different anti-beta8 monoclonal antibody show no alteration in surface expression of alphavbeta8 , indicate that antibody epitope be preserve along with adhesive capability ; ( c ) immunoprecipitation or western blot of cell coexpress alphavbeta8 and mt1-mmp , use polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of beta8 , show no electrophoretic shift or proteolytic degradation product ."
329						"therefore , we have no evidence of modification of alphavbeta8 by mt1-mmp ."
330						how do mt1-mmp interact with the alphavbeta8-tgf-beta1 complex ?
331			"e33,e34"	c19		"we datum suggest that upon ligation of alphavbeta8 with slc , alphavbeta8 and mt1-mmp become closely associate to form a complex on the cell surface ."
332						"the cell surface appear to be require for productive interaction , since the secreted form of alphavbeta8 and mt1-mmp do not mediate activation of tgf-beta ."
333						evidence for a physical association on the cell surface be that alphavbeta8 and mt1-mmp colocalize in substrate contact specifically on lap-beta1 .
334						the nature of the mt1-mmp-beta8 interaction await elucidation by coimmunoprecipitation and domain interaction study .
335			e35	c19		"because the localization of mt1-mmp in lap-beta1 substrate contact be dependent on the presence of beta8 , it be likely that alphavbeta8-slc interaction be require to initiate the recruitment of mt1-mmp ."
336						the dynamic recruitment of mt1-mmp to alphavbeta8-tgf-beta complex could provide a basis for the homeostatic regulation of tgf-beta activity in cellular microenvironment .
337						"although reconstitution of wild-type mt1-mmp be sufficient to support alphavbeta8 mediated activation , other metalloprotease could potentially be involve ."
338						"for instance , mt1-mmp bind to and be potently inhibit by timp-2 , but mt1-mmp-timp-2 complex also serve as a cell surface receptor for mmp-2 , and the function of this complex be activation of mmp-2 ."
339						"as such , it be not inconceivable that mmp-2 could also be involve in alphavbeta8 mediated activation of tgf-beta ."
340						"however , in h1264 cell mmp-2 be unlikely to be involve , since timp-1 , a potent inhibitor of mmp-2 and weak inhibitor of mt1-mmp , have no effect on alphavbeta8 mediated activation of tgf-beta ."
341						"in contrast , beta8 mediate tgf-beta activation be inhibit by timp-2 , suggest that mt1-mmp may alone be sufficient to support beta8 mediated activation of tgf-beta ."
342						"although formally we can not exclude additional role for other mmp or related metalloprotease such as adam or adamt , family member in alphavbeta8 mediated activation of tgf-beta in other system or cell type ."
343						"the beta8 subunit appear to be the only integrin subunit capable of coordinate metalloprotease activity with slc bind to the cell surface because the other lap-beta1 binding integrin be either incapable of activate tgf-beta or , in the case of alphavbeta6 , activate tgf-beta via a metalloprotease independent pathway ."
344						"furthermore , alphavbeta8 mediate tgf-beta activation be solely dependent on metalloprotease and not other protease because inhibitor of aspartyl , serine , and cysteine protease do not inhibit activation ."
345						"thus , alphavbeta8 mediate activation of tgf-beta1 be not dependent on other protease that have be implicate in slc activation , include plasmin , calpain , and cathepsin ."
346						integrin and other cell surface molecule have also be show to localize mmp activity to the cell surface .
347						"for instance , the integrin alphavbeta3 have be show to form a sd stable cell surface complex with mmp-2 and to colocalize with mt1-mmp , whereas cd44 have be show to mediate localization of mmp-9 to the cell surface ."
348						"however , alphavbeta3 and cd44 be unlikely to be require for alphavbeta8 mediated activation of tgf-beta because alphavbeta3 be not express in multiple cell line that support alphavbeta8 mediated activation of tgf-beta and because anti-cd44 antibody do not inhibit alphavbeta8 mediated activation of tgf-beta ( unpublished datum ) ."
349						the selective mmp dependence of alphavbeta8-_NN but not alphavbeta6 mediated activation of tgf-beta1 clearly demonstrate that the mechanism of alphavbeta8-_NN and alphavbeta6 mediated activation of tgf-beta1 be different .
350						a structural basis for these different mechanism may be the striking difference in the predict secondary structure of the extracellular domain of the beta8 and beta6 subunit .
351						different integrin mediated mechanism of tgf-beta activation may have evolve to support distinct biologic function .
352						"for instance , in the airway epithelium , a site where beta8 be normally express , a mechanism to support a low and persistent level of activation of tgf-beta1 be necessary for homeostasis ."
353						"we speculate that alphavbeta8 could sequester SLC to the cell surface where , in response to a environmental cue , change in the local balance of mmp and timp activity could lead to alphavbeta8 dependent liberation of active tgf-beta1 ."
354						"thus , alphavbeta8 mediate activation of tgf-beta1 might liberate the low level of active tgf-beta1 sufficient to promote local paracrine effect but insufficient for undesirable local and systemic fibrogenic effect of tgf-beta1 ."
355						"conversely , if alphavbeta6 be to liberate tgf-beta by a mmp dependent mechanism undesirable pathologic level of tgf-beta might be release locally and into the systemic circulation because after injury expression of alphavbeta6 and mmp be both strongly and rapidly induce ."
356						"in summary , abundant evidence implicate the cytokine tgf-beta1 , integrin , and mmp as important mediator of homeostatic cell behavior ."
357						this article provide the first evidence of the coordination of activity of member of these three major multigene family in the maintenance of homeostasis .
