1						activation of tyrosine kinase by mutation of the gatekeeper threonine
2						protein kinase target by small-molecule inhibitor develop resistance through mutation of the ' gatekeeper ' threonine residue of the active site .
3	uaz:UA-CLine-6116	BaF3 cells	e1,c1	c1	of c-abl , c-src , platelet derive growth factor receptor-alpha and -beta , and epidermal growth factor receptor activate the kinase	here we show that the gatekeeper mutation in the cellular form of c-abl , c-src , platelet derive growth factor receptor-alpha and -beta , and epidermal growth factor receptor activate the kinase and promote malignant transformation of baf3 cell .
4						structural analysis reveal that a network of hydrophobic interaction -- the hydrophobic spine -- characteristic of the active kinase conformation be stabilize by the gatekeeper substitution .
5						substitution of glycine for the residue constitute the spine disrupt the hydrophobic connectivity and inactivate the kinase .
6			e2	c1	a small-molecule inhibitor that maximize complementarity with the dismantled spine ( compound 14 ) inhibit the gatekeeper mutation of bcr-abl-t315us .	furthermore , a small-molecule inhibitor that maximize complementarity with the dismantled spine ( compound 14 ) inhibit the gatekeeper mutation of bcr-abl-t315us .
7						these result demonstrate that mutation of the gatekeeper threonine be a common mechanism of activation for tyrosine kinase and provide structural insight to guide the development of next generation inhibitor .
8						deregulated protein kinase have be link to numerous disease include cancer and diabetes as well as inflammation .
9						the targeted inhibition of protein tyrosine kinase be now well establish as a effective therapeutic regimen for chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) and several solid tumor - .
10						many small-molecule kinase inhibitor have exploit a conserved threonine residue within the atp binding site for bind specificity .
11						this threonine control access of the inhibitor to a hydrophobic pocket deep in the active site that be not contact by atp , hence lead to its designation as a ' gatekeeper ' residue .
12						substitution of the gatekeeper threonine residue with bulky side chain be a common mechanism of resistance to pharmacological atp-competitive kinase inhibitor , .
13						Imatinib have be use successfully to inhibit bcr-abl in cml , c-kit in gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( gist ) and platelet derive growth factor receptor-alpha ( pdgfra ) in hypereosinophilic syndrome ( he ) , .
14						the first imatinib resistant mutation describe in cml patient be a isoleucine substitution at the gatekeeper residue thr315 ( number accord to the sequence for the type ia isoform of c-abl ) .
15						the t315us mutation have be detect in imatinib-naive cml patient and account for ~ 20 % of the total burden of clinical resistance .
16						mutation at the analogous position to thr315 in other imatinib target such as c-kit ( thr670 ) and pdgfra ( thr674 ) have be link to imatinib resistance in patient with gist and he , respectively , .
17						similarly , the gatekeeper mutation t790m in egfr cause resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib , and have be detect in lung cancer patient before drug treatment and in the germ line of a family pedigree with several case of lung cancer , .
18						the association of gatekeeper residue mutation with malignancy even in the absence of treatment with kinase inhibitor imply a role in activation of the transform function of several protein tyrosine kinase .
19						however , the mechanism for this oncogenic activation have not be define .
20						recent inference draw from crystallographic and chemical genetic study suggest that abl and src be regulate in a similar fashion and have highly conserve tertiary structure - .
21						interestingly , mutation of the gatekeeper residue have be note in the sequence of v-src from several independent strain of avian rous sarcoma virus ( rsv ) , but the mechanism responsible for cellular transformation be not clearly define - .
22						on the basis of the strong correlation between substitution of the gatekeeper threonine and oncogenic activation of v-src , and on structural consideration glean from we previous study with dual src-abl kinase inhibitor , we reason that substitution of the gatekeeper threonine residue with bulkier residue would be a common mechanism of activation of tyrosine kinase .
23						in this study , we show that the substitution of a bulkier hydro-phobic residue for the gatekeeper threonine in the human tyrosine kinase activate tyrosine phosphorylation .
24						in silico modeling of the native and gatekeeper variant of different kinase and crystallographic analysis of src-t341us suggest that a isoleucine substitution for the gatekeeper threonine stabilize a ' hydrophobic spine ' that be a characteristic feature of the active state of several kinase .
25						in support of this hypothesis , we show that disruption of hydrophobic connectivity either pharmacologically or by mutagenesis of residue constitute the spine can effectively inhibit the kinase activity of the gatekeeper variant of c-abl and bcr-abl .
26						result
27						gatekeeper mutation in c-src and c-abl activate the kinase
28						the gatekeeper residue threonine be find in many tyrosine kinase .
29						it lie in the hinge region between the n and c lobe of the kinase , where it control access to a hydrophobic pocket that help anchor kinase inhibitor to the active site .
30						because v-src and bcr-abl be already deregulate , enzymatically activate protein kinase , we examine the effect of mutation of the gatekeeper residue on the kinase function of c-src and c-abl isoform1b ( the gatekeeper threonine be residue 334 ) .
31	tissuelist:TS-0510,uaz:UA-CLine-100104	kidney, HEK293T	t1,c2			transient expression in human embryonic kidney cell ( hek293t ) of C-terminally he tag t334us , t334a and g2a c abl mutant reveal elevated kinase activity as compare to native c-abl .
32			e3	t1,c2	myristoylation defective g2a mutant of c-abl , which activate the c-abl kinase	the myristoylation defective g2a mutant of c-abl , which activate the c-abl kinase , be include as a positive control for kinase activation .
33						the t334us variant induce equivalent level of total cellular phosphotyrosine in cell lysate as bcr-abl , whereas t334a and g2a substitution have weaker effect .
34			e4	t1,c2	 increase autophosphorylation of abl variant	after purification of c-abl and its variant by nickel-resin , we likewise observe increase autophosphorylation of abl variant , with t334us show the greatest degree of phosphotyrosine .
35			e5	t1,c2	 induce high level of total cellular phosphotyrosine and increase tyrosine autophosphorylation	similarly , we find that substitution of isoleucine and methionine at the homologous gatekeeper threonine residue in c-src ( t341 ) induce high level of total cellular phosphotyrosine and increase tyrosine autophosphorylation ; methionine substitution , which likewise introduce hydophobicity , have a more dramatic effect than isoleucine substitution .
36						to further explore the structural consequence of amino acid substitution at the gatekeeper threonine , we create the t341k and t341p mutation .
37						lysine , which introduce a strong positive charge into the enzymatic active site , cause reduce kinase activation relative to isoleucine and methionine .
38						proline , which be expect to kink the polypeptide backbone at hinge region , inactivate the enzyme .
39						these observation demonstrate the sensitivity of the enzyme to amino acid substitution at the threonine residue of the hinge region .
40			e6	t1,c2	 tyr416 of c-src , which be phosphorylate in the enzymatically active state , and tyr527 , which be phosphorylate in the inactive state	immuno blotting with phosphospecific antibody against tyr416 of c-src , which be phosphorylate in the enzymatically active state , and tyr527 , which be phosphorylate in the inactive state , reveal that several gatekeeper variant of SRC be express as catalytically active enzyme .
41						Gatekeeper variant of c-abl and c-src transform baf3 cell
42	uaz:UA-CLine-6116	BaF3 cells	e7,c3	c3	kinase activate variant of c-abl and c-src would show similar pattern of autophosphorylation and induce leukemic transformation	next , we seek to determine whether kinase activate variant of c-abl and c-src would show similar pattern of autophosphorylation and induce leukemic transformation in baf3 cell , a cytokine dependent hematopoietic progenitor line that have be widely use in assay of oncogenicity by activate tyrosine kinase , .
43						we express gatekeeper mutant and other variant of c-abl and c-src in baf3 cell by retroviral transduction and puromycin selection .
44	uaz:UA-CLine-100104,uaz:UA-CLine-100104	HEK293T cells,HEK293T cells	e8,c4,e9,c5	c4,c5	kinase activation  |  kinase activation	immuno blotting of total cell protein lysate and purify c-abl and c-src show a comparable pattern of kinase activation as hek293t cell for all variant except c-src-g2a , which show partial kinase activation in hek293t cell but not in baf3 cell .
45	uaz:UA-CLine-6116	BaF3 cells	e10,c6	c6	expression of bcr-abl and activate pdgfrb , pdgfra , fm like tyrosine kinase-3 ( flt3 ) , egfr and janus kinase-2 ( jak2 ) induce interleukin-3 ( il-3 ) - independent proliferatio	expression of bcr-abl and activate pdgfrb , pdgfra , fm like tyrosine kinase-3 ( flt3 ) , egfr and janus kinase-2 ( jak2 ) induce interleukin-3 ( il-3 ) - independent proliferation of baf3 cell , which correlate tightly but not absolutely with malignant transformation , - .
46						we therefore test baf3 cell express c-abl and c-src variant for they capacity to survive and proliferate when culture in the absence of il-3 .
47						like bcr-abl , c-abl-t334us support robust survival in short-term assay ( online ) and rapid il-3-independent proliferation of baf3 cell in prolonged cell culture .
48						in contrast , cell express the weakly activate c-abl variant t334a and g2a or overexpress native c-abl show no detectable enhance survival or proliferation .
49						cell express the activated c-src variant t341us , t341m , t341k , t381k and y530f demonstrate only modest degree of survival and delay il-3-independent cell growth after 10 d of culture .
50						the c-src-g2a and c-src-t341a cell show neither survival nor proliferation .
51						take together with the autophosphorylation datum , these result demonstrate a correlation between the level of kinase activation and cellular transformation for c-abl and further suggest that c-abl be more effective at transform this hematopoietic cell line than activate variant of SRC .
52						the longer latency of transformation by src kinase variant may be due to the fact that activate src kinase alone be not sufficient for transformation and may require additional epigenetic or genetic alteration to transform the baf3 cell .
53	taxonomy:10090	mouse	s1			to determine whether the in vitro assay of il-3-independent cell survival and proliferation correlate with the development of leukemia in vivo , we inject baf3 cell express the c-abl and c-src variant into syngenic balb and c mouse and observe for leukemia induction , with bcr-abl-expressing baf3 cell serve as a control .
54						mouse inject with c-abl-t334us or bcr-abl-transformed baf3 cell die within 4 week with peripheral blood leukocytosis and massive splenomegaly .
55						in contrast , none of the other variant of c-abl or c-src develop leukemia .
56	uaz:UA-CLine-6116	BaF3 cells	e11,c7	s1,c7	mutation at the gatekeeper threonine can activate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of both c-abl and c-src , but only activate variant of c-abl induce leukemia	these datum demonstrate that mutation at the gatekeeper threonine can activate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of both c-abl and c-src , but only activate variant of c-abl induce leukemia in baf3 cell , consistent with a long standing observation that activate src be ineffective at transform baf3 cell .
57						gatekeeper mutation in receptor tyrosine kinase be activate
58	uaz:UA-CLine-100104	HEK293T cells	e12,c8	c8	transient expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase pdgfrb and its gatekeeper mutation variant ( t681a , t681us and t681m ) in hek293t cell show enhance kinase autophosphorylation and increase tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular protein .	transient expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase pdgfrb and its gatekeeper mutation variant ( t681a , t681us and t681m ) in hek293t cell show enhance kinase autophosphorylation and increase tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular protein .
59						like the c-src kinase , introduction of the methionine residue ( pdgfrb-t681m ) generate the most active kinase ( online ) .
60						for PDGFRA , only the t674m variant be associate with kinase activation , as demonstrate by autophosphorylation of purify protein .
61						for unknown reason , we be unable to achieve adequate expression of egfr in hek293t cell .
62	uaz:UA-CLine-6116	BaF3 cells	c9			we next express these receptor tyrosine kinase mutant in baf3 cell .
63			e13	c9	 kinase activation for each of the gatekeeper variant of pdgfrb ( t681a , t681us and t681m ; ) , PDGFRA ( t674us and t674m ; ) and egfr ( t790us , t790m and l858r ; )	immunoblotting of total cell lysate and partially purify protein show kinase activation for each of the gatekeeper variant of pdgfrb ( t681a , t681us and t681m ; ) , PDGFRA ( t674us and t674m ; ) and egfr ( t790us , t790m and l858r ; ) .
64			e14	c9	this mutation36 .	for these experiment , egfr-l858r serve as a control , because egfr activation and baf3 cell transformation have be describe previously for this mutation .
65					the result of these gatekeeper mutagenesis study reveal that , like c-abl and c-src , pdgfrb be maximally activate by the substitution with bulkier residue ( isoleucine and methionine ) and more modestly activate by alanine substitution , whereas pdgfra and egfr can be activate only by the substitution with isoleucine or methionine but be tolerant of substitution with smaller side chain substitution such as alanine .	the result of these gatekeeper mutagenesis study reveal that , like c-abl and c-src , pdgfrb be maximally activate by the substitution with bulkier residue ( isoleucine and methionine ) and more modestly activate by alanine substitution , whereas pdgfra and egfr can be activate only by the substitution with isoleucine or methionine but be tolerant of substitution with smaller side chain substitution such as alanine .
66						unlike bcr-abl or c-abl-t334us , none of the receptor bear gatekeeper mutation support short term il-3-free survival in baf3 cell ( online ) .
67						like c-src-t341m / I , baf3 cell carry receptor bear the gatekeeper variant pdgfrb-t681us , pdgfrb-t681m ; pdgfra-t674us , pdgfra-t674m ; egfr-t790us , egfr-t790m and egfr-l858r show delay but robust growth of baf3 cell after 9-10 d .
68						the longer latency of transformation by these receptor kinase variant may be due to the fact that the activated kinase alone be not sufficient for transformation and may require additional epigenetic or genetic alteration to transform the baf3 cell .
69						these datum demonstrate that the gatekeeper mutation activate the kinase activity in receptor tyrosine kinase and can transform the cytokine dependent cell line baf3 , although with longer latency than for activate variant of c-abl .
70						a hydrophobic spine be assemble during kinase activation
71						Crystal structure of protein kinase in they active and inactive conformation have provide a general understanding of they regulation via intramolecular autoregulatory interaction .
72						typically , activation involve change in the position and orientation of the activation loop and the catalytic c-helix .
73						a surface comparison of active kinase structure have reveal a network of highly conserve hydrophobic or amino-aromatic interaction call the hydrophobic spine , which stabilize the active kinase conformation .
74						in abl kinase , the spine comprise four residue , leu320 , met309 , phe401 and his380 , which form a chain of hydrophobic interaction from the n lobe via the active site to the tyr412 of the activation loop .
75						these interaction be disrupt in the inactive state .
76						the gatekeeper residue thr334 be situate near the tip of the hydrophobic spine .
77						we modeling analysis suggest that substitution of a bulkier hydrophobic residue at this position would stabilize the active state by strengthen the spine .
78						in we model , leu403 serve as a bipositional switch that position asp400 of the dfg motif in the correct orientation to enable catalysis ( online ) .
79						in the active state the backbone of leu403 coordinate arg381 of the catalytic hrd motif , whereas in the inactive state the sidechain of leu403 stabilize phe401 in the catalytically quiescent ' dfg-out ' conformation .
80						furthermore , computational modeling of the published structure of src and egfr reveal similar hydrophobic interaction in SRC ( online ) and egfr ( online ) , where the gatekeeper residue sit at the top of the spine , stabilize the active state .
81						the active src and egfr kinase maintain a hydrophobic spine from the gatekeeper threonine to tyr419 and tyr869 of the activation loop , respectively .
82						these interaction be disrupt in the inactive state .
83						as in ABL , leu410 of src and leu858 of egfr serve as a bipositional switch for kinase regulation , .
84						altogether , these in silico analysis suggest that gatekeeper mutant stabilize the active state of the kinase by contribute to the hydrophobic spine .
85						SRC-T341I adopt a active conformation
86	taxonomy:9031	chicken	s2,e15	s2	c-src kinase domain ( residue 251-533 ) in complex with atpgammaS	we crystallize the isoleucine substitution of the gatekeeper residue of the chicken c-src kinase domain ( residue 251-533 ) in complex with atpgamma and determine the structure to a resolution of 2.0 a .
87						the four molecule present in the asymmetric unit be in virtually identical conformation ; further discussion focus on one of these .
88						there be well define electron density for the adenine , ribose and the alpha-phosphate group of atpgamma and less well define density for the beta-_NN and gamma-phosphate .
89			e16	s2	the activation loop be fully order and tyr419 be phosphorylate .	the activation loop be fully order and tyr419 be phosphorylate .
90						the overall conformation of the c-src-t341us mutant resemble that of the activation loop phosphorylate lck ( pdb 1qpc ) , where phe408 of the dfg motif form contact with residue his387 and met317 of the hydrophobic spine , such that the hydrophobic spine be assemble .
91						however , in the inactive state of the src kinase conformation , the hydrophobic spine be cripple and the activation loop be not phosphorylate and extend .
92						gatekeeper mutation efficiently organize the active site
93						we compare the structure of the gatekeeper variant of c-src with a high-resolution structure of a wild-type src family kinase -- lck bind to the atp analog amp-pnp , also in the active conformation ( pdb 1qpc ) .
94						in both structure , a active-site lysine residue ( src lys298 and lck lys273 ) form a hydrogen bond with a glutamate residue in helix alphac ( src glu310 and lck glu288 ) , but the conformation of the lysine residue be different in the two structure .
95						in the wild-type lck , two water molecule be interdigitate between thr316 and lys273 , and the lysine side chain do not form hydrogen bond with the phosphate group of the atp analog ( the closest distance between the lysine nitrogen and a phosphate oxygen be 5.5 a ) .
96						in the src structure , the substitution of isoleucine lead to the exclusion of these water molecule and the rearrangement of the lysine side chain , which pack closely to the isoleucine residue and form a hydrogen bond to the alpha-phosphate of the nucleotide ( n-o distance of 3.4 a ) .
97						the hydrophobic packing of ile341 and lys298 seal off the interior of the kinase domain , thereby exclude water and potentiate the hydrophobic spine and interaction of lys298 with atp relative to the wild-type structure .
98						a similar orientation of the lysine residue and atp be see in the structure of kinase with hydrophobic residue at the gatekeeper position of the insulin receptor kinase .
99						on the basis of these observation , we infer that the t341us mutation activate the kinase by optimize the coordination of atp and by stabilize the hydrophobic spine .
100						mutagenesis of the hydrophobic spine cause kinase inactivation
101						we model predict that kinase activity be dependent on assembly of the hydrophobic spine .
102						to test this , we mutate all four residue that constitute the spine in the abl kinase ( leu320 , met309 , phe401 and thr334 ) to glycine and analyze kinase activity in a cell base assay .
103						m309g , f401g and t334g completely abrogate kinase activity , whereas l320g show a decreased level of phosphorylation relative to abl-t334us .
104						molecular modeling of the l320g reveal only a modest effect on spine assembly , consistent with the modestly reduce kinase activation of abl-t315us , whereas , m309g and f401g mutation completely disrupt the assembly of the spine , inactivate the kinase .
105						similarly , double or triple mutation of the residue that disrupt the spine assembly also result in a inactive kinase .
106						these mutagenesis datum suggest that the hydrophobic spine be a key structural element of the enzymatically active conformation of the abl kinase .
107			e18	c11,c10	compound 14 inhibit the gatekeeper variant of bcr-abl	compound 14 inhibit the gatekeeper variant of bcr-abl
108						give we hypothesis that gatekeeper mutation stabilize the hydrophobic spine , we reason that a small-molecule atp-competitive inhibitor that can disrupt the hydrophobic spine may achieve the necessary binding affinity to successfully inhibit the kinase activity of gatekeeper mutant .
109						we perform structural alignment of the abl kinase crystallize with different inhibitor to identify a inhibitor that can dismantle the spine without any physical interaction with the activation loop .
110						by this analysis , we identify compound 14 as be able to efficiently compete for the spine residue without directly affect the mobility of the activation loop .
111						compound 14 be generate by a rational ' hybrid design ' approach by append a trifluoromethyl group to the parent inhibitor pd166326 ( ref ; ) .
112						compound 14 , like imatinib , disrupt the assembly of the hydrophobic spine , thereby lock the kinase in a inactive ' dfg-out ' conformation .
113						the shape of compound 14 resemble that of the core of imatinib , with the key difference that the hydrophilic methyl-piperazine group in imatinib be replace with the more hydrophobic trifluoromethyl moiety .
114						the structure also suggest that the trifluoromethylbenzamide ring of compound 14 compete for phe401 of the dfg motif without have any direct physical interaction with the activation loop .
115						therefore , we reason that compound 14 may , at a higher concentration , efficiently inhibit the gatekeeper mutant abl t315us by destabilizing the active state .
116						additionally , the trifluoromethyl group of compound 14 fit into a hydrophobic cavity create by the disruption of the spine residue phe401 and his387 , and this may provide extra anchorage for affinity .
117						we test compound 14 and the parent inhibitor pd166326 for they ability to inhibit native and gatekeeper variant of abl and bcr-abl .
118						compound 14 inhibit c-abl-t334us , bcr-abl and bcr-abl-t315us variant with a 50 % inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) of 0.25 mum , 0.09 mum and 0.590 mum , respectively .
119						in contrast , pd166326 barely inhibit c-abl-t334us , with a ic50 of 8.0 mum , and show a complete lack of activity up to 10 mum against bcr-abl-t315us .
120						similarly , imatinib and nilotinib have be show to be completely resistant against the gatekeeper mutant , , .
121						these result demonstrate that the gatekeeper mutant stabilize the active state by potentiate the hydrophobic spine , and disruption of the spine by a small-molecule inhibitor can efficiently inhibit the gatekeeper mutant .
122						although imatinib and nilotinib disrupt the hydrophobic spine , the fact that they fail to show any activity against the gatekeeper mutant may be due to the requirement of higher free energy to destabilize the active state impose by they physical interaction with the activation loop .
123						discussion
124						substitution of the gatekeeper threonine residue by isoleucine in the bcr-abl oncoprotein ( t315us ) be the first resistance mutation note in imatinib treated patient , and mutation in the homologous residue have emerge as a common mechanism of resistance for numerous kinase .
125						structural study have show that this threonine stabilize imatinib binding through hydrogen-bond interaction and regulate access to a deep hydrophobic pocket in the active site , thus provide a compelling reason why Rstitution should mediate drug resistance via a steric mechanism alone .
126						however , the identification of t315us in a significant cohort of cml patient with primary imatinib resistance , , the association of germline mutation in the gatekeeper residue of egfr in familial lung cancer and the historical identification of gatekeeper residue mutation in transform isolate of the v-src viral oncoprotein imply a role for this mutation in promote malignancy that have hitherto be unexplained .

132						biochemical and structural analysis of protein kinase have reveal that a complex set of conformational mechanism regulate the catalytically active and quiescent state .
133						conformational dynamics of the activation loop and the conserved c helix contribute to formation of a ion pair between a crucial lysine residue within the beta3 strand of the n lobe and a crucial glutamate residue within the c helix .
134						ultimately , protein dynamics ensure that a conserved dfg motif lie at the tip of the activation loop be orient in a manner that allow coordinate binding of magnesium and atp .
135						in adopt the enzymatically competent ' dfg in ' conformation , the n lobe and c lobe move toward one another to accommodate these structural change .
136						we study support a model whereby the hydrophobic spine serve as a structural element link the n and c lobe .
137						the gatekeeper residue , by virtue of its location , stabilize the spine in the active conformation , whereas the inactive state be stabilize by autoinhibitory regulatory domain interaction and by association with negative regulatory protein , .
138						mutation that disrupt this autoinhibition promote enzymatically active kinase conformation that be intrinsically resistant to imatinib binding , .
139						although direct steric hindrance have be invoke to explain the resistance of bcr-abl-t315us , kit-t670us , pdgfra-t674us and egfr-t790m to kinase inhibitor binding , , , , we datum suggest that threonine mutation act as well to promote the assembly of a enzymatically active kinase conformation by stabilize the hydrophobic spine .
140						we anticipate that this regulatory mechanism be conserve across the kinase family .
141						substitution of the gatekeeper threonine residue with alanine , a smaller hydrophobic residue , likewise cause kinase activation , but less robustly than substituton with isoleucine or methionine .
142						a recent report use hydrogen-exchange ( hx ) study of the native and gatekeeper mutate erk2-q103a kinase demonstrate that substitution of smaller hydrophobic residue create a cavity within the hydrophobic cluster that destabilize the autoinhibited state and increase the flexibility of the dfg motif and activation loop , and increase flexibility of the activation segment would be expect to favor autophosphorylation .
143						give we datum show that gatekeeper residue mutation cause kinase activation in several receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinase , we speculate that this phenomenon may be a generic feature of kinase regulation that help to explain why this class of mutation have be observe in drug-naive patient .
144						in future drug design , structure that maximize complementarity to the dismantled spine should be favor , as these represent a inhibitor class that optimize specificity by recognize inactive kinase conformation while gain sufficient affinity to be active against kinase that carry mutation at the gatekeeper residue .
