1						Netrins and neogenin promote myotube formation
2	tissuelist:TS-0650	skeletal myoblasts	c1			Differentiation of skeletal myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes is a multistep process orchestrated by several families of transcription factors , including myogenic bHLH and NFAT proteins .
3						The activities of these factors and formation of myotubes are regulated by signal transduction pathways , but few extracellular factors that might initiate such signals have been identified .
4						One exception is a cell surface complex containing promyogenic Ig superfamily members ( CDO and BOC ) and cadherins .
5						Netrins and their receptors are established regulators of axon guidance , but little is known of their function outside the nervous system .
6						We report here that myoblasts express the secreted factor netrin-3 and its receptor , neogenin .
7						These proteins stimulate myotube formation and enhance myogenic bHLH- and NFAT dependent transcription .

10						Introduction
11						During skeletal muscle development mesodermal precursor cells give rise to committed myoblasts that , after proliferation and migration to appropriate sites in the embryo , exit the cell cycle , express muscle specific genes , and fuse into multinucleated myofibers .
12						This process is coordinated by a family of myogenic bHLH transcription factors that includes Myf5 , MyoD , myogenin , and MRF4 .
13						These factors function in concert with additional families of transcription factors , including MEF2 and NFAT .
14						The activity of such transcription factors can be regulated by signal transduction pathways , although the mechanisms involved are not fully understood .
15						Cell culture systems have proven very useful in analyzing the processes by which myoblasts differentiate into multinucleated myotubes .
16						Differentiation of myoblast cell lines is induced by transferring confluent cultures into mitogen deficient differentiation medium ( DM ) , after which they induce the differentiation factor myogenin , withdraw from the cell cycle , elongate and align , express muscle specific proteins , and fuse .
17						Several signaling pathways have been implicated in promoting myogenic differentiation ; however , because the most commonly used stimulus for in vitro differentiation is removal of serum , the extracellular factors and receptors that initiate these pathways during myogenesis are largely unknown .
18						Differentiation of cells in the skeletal muscle lineage is also positively regulated by cell-cell contact .
19						We have been studying this process with particular emphasis on the role of CDO , an orphan receptor of the Ig and fibronectin type III ( FNIII ) repeat family .
20						CDO is expressed at high levels in the myogenic compartment during embryogenesis , and mice lacking CDO via targeted mutagenesis display delayed muscle development .
21			e3,e4	c1	CDO also promotes myogenesis in vitro , signaling through a yet-to-be-identified pathway to posttranslationally activate MyoD family members through increased heterodimerization with their E protein partners .	CDO also promotes myogenesis in vitro , signaling through a yet-to-be-identified pathway to posttranslationally activate MyoD family members through increased heterodimerization with their E protein partners .
22						CDO is a component of a cell surface complex found at sites of cell-cell contact that also includes the related Ig and FNIII protein BOC and the promyogenic cell adhesion molecules , N- and M-cadherin .
23						We have proposed that this complex mediates some of the positive effects of cell-cell contact on myogenesis .
24						Netrins comprise a small family of secreted proteins related to laminins that associate with cell membranes and ECM .
25						Netrins function as evolutionarily conserved axon guidance cues able to trigger both attractive and repulsive responses mediated via two classes of cell surface receptors .
26						The first class belongs , like CDO , to the Ig and FNIII repeat family and includes DCC and neogenin ; the second class contain Ig and thrombospondin repeats and includes the UNC-5H proteins .
27						DCC receptors mediate attractive responses to netrins , whereas complexes of DCC and UNC-5 mediate repulsion .
28						Functions for netrins and netrin receptors outside the nervous system have received much less attention .
29						Several observations make netrins and their receptors interesting candidates as regulators of myogenesis .
30						First , mRNAs for netrin-1 , netrin-3 , and neogenin are expressed in somites and developing skeletal muscle between E10 .5 and E14 .5 during murine embryogenesis .
31						Second , netrin-1 signals in neurons to activate several pathways also implicated in promoting myogenesis , including the calcineurin , p38 and p42 and 44 MAPK , and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways .
32						Third , guidance of axons by extracellular cues requires localized alterations in the actin cytoskeleton of growth cones , and DCC can signal to modulate the activity of specific Rho GTPases , known regulators of actin dynamics .
33						It seems highly likely that the elongation , alignment , and fusion steps that occur during myotube formation also require alterations of the cytoskeleton .
34						Finally , netrin-1 and neogenin function in an adhesive , rather than a guidance , role during mammary gland morphogenesis , an activity that could contribute to the promyogenic effects of cell-cell contact .
35						Interestingly , neogenin morphant zebrafish were recently reported to display defects in somitogenesis ( before muscle development ) that are consistent with a potential role for neogenin in convergent extension .
36						We report here that cultured myoblasts express neogenin and netrin-3 .
37						Up- or down modulation of neogenin levels increases or decreases myotube formation , respectively , and neogenin can enhance the activity of myogenic bHLH- and NFAT dependent reporter constructs .
38						Treatment of myoblasts with recombinant netrin promotes myotube formation and NFAT activation in a neogenin dependent manner .
39						Finally , neogenin and CDO form a complex , and CDO modulates netrin signaling .
40						These results suggest that netrin-3 and neogenin promote myogenic differentiation by an autocrine mechanism , possibly as components of a higher order complex of several promyogenic cell surface proteins .
41						Results
42						Expression of netrins and netrin receptors in cultured myoblasts
43						Our interest in Ig and FNIII repeat proteins led us to examine expression of netrin receptors of this class during myogenic differentiation in vitro .
44						Western blot analyses of C2C12 myoblasts revealed a uniform level of neogenin in cells cultured in growth medium ( GM ) and cells transferred into DM over a period of 4 d ( A ) .
45						This contrasts with expression of CDO , which was transiently up regulated during the differentiation time course ( A ; ) .
46						Duplicate blots probed with an antibody against DCC revealed only trace levels of this protein ( unpublished data ) .
47						F3 , a myoblast line derived by treatment of 10T1 and 2 fibroblasts with 5-azacytidine , also expressed neogenin under both GM and DM conditions ( B ) .
48						10T1 and 2 fibroblasts and 10T1 and 2 cells converted to myoblasts by stable expression of MyoD expressed indistinguishable levels of neogenin ( C ) ; again , this contrasts with CDO expression , which was induced by MyoD ( C ; ) .
49						Finally , expression of oncogenic Ras in C2C12 cells , which results in reduction of MyoD and CDO and blocks differentiation , had no effect on neogenin levels ( unpublished data ) .
50						Together , these results indicate that neogenin is expressed in the myogenic lineage , but its expression is not dependent on myogenic factors .

54						Cultures were brought to ~ 90 % confluence ( day 0 ) and shifted into DM for the indicated period of time and harvested .

58						( C ) Western blot analysis of 10T1 and 2 cell derivatives .
59						10T1 and 2 cells stably transfected with a control expression vector ( - ) or with a MyoD expression vector ( + ) were cultured in DM for 24 h. Blots were probed with antibodies against the indicated proteins .
60						( D ) Northern blot analysis of netrin-3 mRNA expression during C2C12 cell differentiation .
61						The ethidium bromide stained gel is shown as a loading control .
62						Specific netrins were examined in a similar fashion .
63						Netrin-3 was expressed in both C2C12 and F3 cells under GM conditions and levels increased when cells were transferred into DM .
64						This increase was also apparent at the mRNA level , with C2C12 cells displaying a single netrin-3 transcript of ~ 7 kb ( D ) .
65						In contrast , duplicate Western and Northern blots probed for expression of netrin-1 protein and mRNA , respectively , did not reveal a signal , despite the ability to detect netrin-1 produced transiently ( unpublished data ) .
66						Netrin-3 produced by C2C12 cells was not observed in the culture medium supernatant ( unpublished data ) , suggesting that , like endogenous netrins-1 and -2 in chick floor plate and netrin-1 in adult rat spinal cord , it is likely to be associated with cell membranes and and or ECM .
67						10T1 and 2 and 10T1 and 2-MyoD cells also expressed netrin-3 ( C ) .
68						It is concluded that myoblast cell lines and 10T1 and 2 cells express both netrin-3 and one of its receptors , neogenin , raising the possibility that an autocrine signaling pathway may exist in these cells .
69						Neogenin levels regulate myotube formation
70						"To assess a role for neogenin in myogenesis , we transfected different "" strains "" of C2C12 cells and F3 cells with a vector engineered to drive expression of a human neogenin cDNA and a puromycin resistance gene ."
71						Transfected cultures were selected and analyzed for neogenin expression .
72						Stable overexpression of neogenin was achieved only in one strain of C2C12 cells .
73						These cells , previously described by us and designated as C2C12 ( E ) cells , are highly differentiation-proficient in that they : expressed detectable myogenin before a shift into DM ; ( b ) were less sensitive to inhibition of differentiation by moderate levels of serum ( e.g. , 5 % FBS ) ; and ( c ) completed the differentiation process over a 2-d time period .
74						These cells were used for all subsequent experiments and are simply referred to as C2C12 cells .
75						Neogenin vector transfectants ( C2C12 and neogenin cells ) produced two- to threefold more neogenin than control vector transfectants ( C2C12 and puro cells ; A ) .
76						Overproduction of neogenin modestly decreased proliferation of C2C12 cells in GM , relative to vector controls , and did not alter their morphology in GM ( not depicted ) .
77						When observed 24 h after shifting the cultures to medium containing 5 % FBS ( a time at which the differentiation process was in mid-progression ) , C2C12 and neogenin cells had formed larger myotubes with more nuclei than did C2C12 and puro cells ( B ) .
78						C2C12 and neogenin cultures displayed an increase in the total number of nuclei present in myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) - positive cells and in the average number of nuclei and myotube ( C ) .
79						When analyzed for expression of muscle specific proteins , including MyoD , myogenin , MHC , and troponin T ( TnT ) , C2C12 and neogenin cells showed accelerated expression of TnT , but otherwise were similar to C2C12 and puro cells ( D ) .
80						Overexpression of neogenin therefore resulted in enhanced formation of myotubes without dramatic changes in several biochemical markers of differentiation .
81						Figure 2 .
82						Overexpression of neogenin promotes myotube formation by C2C12 cells .
83						( A ) C2C12 cells were stably transfected with a control expression vector lacking a cDNA ( - ) or with an expression vector harboring a neogenin cDNA ( + ) .
84						Western blots of the indicated cells were probed with neogenin or , as a control , pan-cadherin antibodies .
85						The exposure of this film was for a shorter duration than the neogenin blot shown in , so as to more clearly highlight the quantitative difference between the transfectants .

90						( D ) Western blot analysis of muscle specific proteins by C2C12 cell transfectants over a 2-d time course of differentiation .
91						To assess the effect of reducing neogenin levels on myotube formation , an RNAi approach was taken .
92						A sequence from the mouse neogenin coding region was inserted into the pSilencer vector , and was cotransfected with a GFP expression vector into C2C12 cells ; the pSilencer vector without an insert was used as a control .
93						Transfected cultures were sorted for the presence of GFP and assessed for reduction of neogenin levels .
94						A representative Western blot is shown in A. GFP sorted cells that received the neogenin RNAi vector produced fewer and smaller myotubes than sorted control transfectants .
95						To more precisely quantify this effect , C2C12 cells were cotransfected with the neogenin RNAi vector or the vector lacking an insert , plus a plasmid directing expression of nlacZ ( encoding nuclear localized beta-galactosidase ; beta-gal ) .
96						2 d later , the cultures were transferred to 5 % FBS for 24 h , and then fixed and double stained for MHC and beta-gal activity .
97						When control vector-transfectants fused with nontransfected cells , many ( often most ) of the nuclei in the myotube became positive for beta-gal activity , presumably because the cytoplasmically translated protein diffused within the myotube ( B ) .
98						When the number of nuclei in beta-gal + cells was scored , ~ 56 % had more than five nuclei , ~ 21 % had two to four nuclei and ~ 23 % had a single nucleus ( C ) .
99						In contrast , the distribution of beta-gal + cells that received the neogenin RNAi vector was strongly skewed toward single nucleus containing cells , with only about ~ 5 % displaying more than five nuclei ( C ) .
100						Cells that received an RNAi vector containing a neogenin sequence that was ineffective at reducing neogenin protein levels behaved equivalently to those that received the vector lacking an insert ( unpublished data ) .

105						GFP positive cells were sorted and cell lysates probed with antibodies to neogenin or , as a control , a pan-cadherin antibody .
106						( B ) C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with pSilencer ( control ) or pSilencer containing RNAi sequences targeted against neogenin , plus an expression vector for nlacZ ( nuclear targeted beta-gal ) .

112						Cultures were fixed and double stained for MHC and beta-gal activity .
113						Bar , 0.2 mm .
114						( E ) Quantification of myotube formation .
115						Values represent means of triplicate determinations + /- 1 SD .
116						The transfection efficiencies for these experiments were ~ 10 % , a value chosen to minimize fusion of independent beta-gal + transfectants .
117						As a further test of specificity , we sought to rescue the cell fusion defect produced by neogenin RNAi via ectopic expression of the human neogenin cDNA .
118						"The sequence of the RNAi used to target endogenous mouse neogenin is not fully conserved in the human cDNA , and therefore the human neogenin expression vector should be impervious to RNAi mediated "" knockdown "" ."
119						Three conditions were studied : ( 1 ) C2C12 cells cotransfected with pSilencer lacking RNAi sequences and the control vector for human neogenin expression ( pSil and pBP ) ; ( 2 ) cells cotransfected with pSilencer containing neogenin RNAi sequences and the control vector for human neogenin expression ( RNAi and pBP ) ; and ( 3 ) cells cotransfected with pSilencer containing RNAi sequences and the human neogenin expression vector ( RNAi and hNeogenin ) .
120						For unknown reasons , the pSil and pBP transfectants reproducibly produced fewer myotubes with more than five nuclei than cells that received only the control pSilencer vector ( ~ 30 % vs. ~ 56 % , respectively ; compare D with ) .
121						Importantly , however , RNAi and pBP transfectants were strongly blocked from forming myotubes , whereas the RNAi and hNeogenin transfectants closely resembled the control pSil and pBP cultures .
122						Therefore , forced expression of neogenin rescued the effects of RNAi to neogenin , further indicating that the effects of the RNAi were specific .
123						It is concluded that reduction of neogenin levels reduced myoblasts ' ability to participate in the formation of myotubes .
124						Together , with the overexpression data in , these results strongly suggest that neogenin levels are rate limiting for this aspect of C2C12 myogenesis .
125						Recombinant netrin promotes myotube formation
126						To assess the effects of netrin-3 on myoblast cell lines , we initially attempted to synthesize recombinant mouse protein in COS and 293T cells but , similar to the findings of , were unable to produce sufficient quantities of secreted , soluble material .
127						"Mouse netrin-3 is orthologous to human netrin-2L and , although not orthologous to chicken netrin-2 , is grouped with both these proteins by dendrogram analyses in a sub-category designated "" netrin-2-like "" , distinguishable from a "" netrin-1-like "" group ."
128						Therefore , we chose to use recombinant chicken netrin-2 for this work as it is commercially available .
129						C2C12 cells were cultured in GM , then transferred into 5 % FBS plus or minus chicken netrin-2 , and observed 24 h later .
130						C2C12 cell proliferation was not altered by netrin-2 treatment .
131						However , although the control cultures displayed small MHC + myotubes under these conditions , the netrin-2-treated cultures showed distinctly larger myotubes with increases in the total number of nuclei in MHC + cells and in the average number of nuclei and myotube .
132						When analyzed for expression of muscle specific proteins , the cells that received netrin-2 produced significantly more TnT than control cells , but the levels of MyoD , myogenin , MHC , and CDO were unchanged ( C ) .
133						Thus , similar to overexpression of neogenin , treatment of C2C12 cells with a neogenin ligand resulted in enhanced myotube formation and alterations in expression of TnT , but not several other muscle markers .
134						Figure 4 .
135						Netrin-2 promotes myotube formation .
136						( A ) Photomicrographs of C2C12 cells were treated with 5 % FBS plus or minus recombinant chicken netrin-2 for 24 h , and fixed and stained with an antibody to MHC .
137						Bars : ( top ) 0.5 mm ; ( bottom ) 0.2 mm .

140						( C ) Western blot analysis of muscle specific proteins by C2C12 cells treated with 5 % FBS plus or minus recombinant chicken netrin-2 for 24 h. Cell lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies .
141						To assess whether netrin-2 exerted its effects on myotube formation in a manner dependent on neogenin , a C2C12 cell derivative that stably expressed the neogenin RNAi vector was generated ; these cells expressed considerably less neogenin than control transfectants and produced fewer and smaller myotubes than control transfectants when shifted to DME and 5 % FBS for 24 h ( , A-C ) .
142						When the control cells were treated with netrin-2 under these conditions they behaved similarly to parental C2C12 cells , forming larger myotubes with more nuclei .
143						In contrast , the neogenin RNAi expressing cells were not affected by netrin-2 .
144						Therefore , it is concluded that the ability of netrin-2 to promote myotube formation by C2C12 cells depends on the netrin receptor , neogenin .

152						Neogenin activates myogenic bHLH factor- and NFAT dependent reporter constructs
153						CDO signals to enhance myogenic bHLH factor dependent transcription , and netrin-1 signals through DCC to stimulate NFAT mediated transcription .
154						Therefore , we assessed whether neogenin could stimulate reporter constructs specific for myogenic bHLH factors and NFAT .
155						In transient assays of C2C12 cells , cotransfection of the neogenin expression vector enhanced activity of a reporter construct driven by four reiterated myogenic E-boxes ( 4Rtk-luc ) , approximately threefold above that seen with a control vector lacking a cDNA insert ( A ) .
156						Cotransfection of 10T1 and 2 fibroblasts with expression vectors for MyoD and its heterodimeric partner E12 led to activation of 4Rtk-luc , and this activity was also enhanced approximately threefold by coexpression of neogenin ( B ) .
157						However , neogenin could not activate the reporter in the absence of MyoD ( unpublished data ) .

170						Cotransfection of the neogenin expression vector into either C2C12 or 10T1 and 2 cells enhanced NFAT-luciferase reporter activity approximately twofold ; in contrast , a CDO expression vector had no effect on NFAT dependent transcription .
171						Of the various NFATc isoforms implicated in myogenesis , only NFATc3 is activated in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts .

Immunoblots probed with an antibody specific to NFATc3 revealed increased levels of NFATc3 after 6 h of netrin-2 treatment , including a more quickly migrating form that presumably represents dephosphorylated , activated NFATc3 ( E ) .
173						This response returned to baseline , or lower , within 30 h. Consistent with this relatively short duration of action , addition of netrin-2 to control or neogenin transfected cultures enhanced NFAT-luciferase reporter activity by only ~ 40 % in each case ( unpublished data ) .
174						To assess whether the effects of netrin-2 on NFATc3 were dependent on neogenin , C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with neogenin RNAi or control vectors plus a GFP expression vector , sorted , and treated with medium containing 5 % FBS , plus or minus netrin-2 .
175						Netrin-2 treatment of control transfectants resulted in increased levels of NFATc3 , similar to parental C2C12 cells ; in contrast , neogenin RNAi transfectants failed to respond to netrin-2 ( F ) .
176						The C2C12 derivative that stably expressed neogenin RNAi displayed a similar lack of response ( G ) .
177						Thus , as seen with enhancement of myotube formation , netrin-2 required neogenin to exert its effects on NFATc3 levels .

198						Neogenin was brought down by CDO antibodies when CDO was coexpressed , but not when CDO was omitted ; analogously , CDO was brought down by neogenin antibodies in a neogenin dependent fashion .
199	uaz:UA-CLine-1001000,uaz:UA-CLine-100002	c2c12 cell, 293T cells	c8,c9,e12	c8,c9	association between neogenin and CDO	As seen with C2C12 cells , collection of transiently transfected 293T cells as a single-cell suspension in EDTA did not diminish the association between neogenin and CDO ( F ) .
200						Additionally , when 293T transfectants that expressed only CDO were cocultured with transfectants that expressed only neogenin , immunoprecipitation of either protein failed to coprecipitate the other , an interaction expected to be observed if the binding occurred in a trans manner ( unpublished data ) .
201						Together , the transient expression data : establish the specificity of the antibodies ; ( b ) confirm the cis nature of the CDO-neogenin association ; and ( c ) indicate that additional , cell type specific factors are not likely to be required for this interaction .
202						CDO contains an ectodomain comprised of five Ig and three FNIII repeats , a single pass transmembrane region , and a 270-amino acid cytoplasmic tail .
203						To identify regions of CDO involved in complex formation with neogenin , a series of CDO deletion mutants that lack each individual Ig and FNIII repeat were tested for their ability to co-immunoprecipitate neogenin .
204						"293T cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for neogenin and either wild-type CDO or individual CDO mutants ( designated by the symbol "" Delta "" followed by the deleted domain ) ."
205						Cell lysates were precipitated with antibodies to the CDO intracellular region , and the immunoprecipitates blotted and probed with antibodies to neogenin or CDO ( G ) .
206						The CDO mutants DeltaIg1 and DeltaFN2 were deficient ( though not completely defective ) in their ability to associate with neogenin , relative to full-length CDO .
207						In contrast , DeltaIg2 , DeltaIg4 , DeltaIg5 , and DeltaFN1 displayed no significant reduction in this property .
208						DeltaFN3 gave somewhat variable results over multiple experiments , suggesting it may be involved in neogenin binding but is not as important as Ig1 or FN2 .
209						Deletion of Ig repeat 3 apparently resulted in destabilization of CDO , as only very weak expression of this protein was observed .
210						A construct in which the CDO signal sequence was linked directly to its transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions ( designated CDO ( TMintra ) ; Kang et al. , 2002 ) was brought down in neogenin immunoprecipitates , albeit inefficiently , suggesting that the intracellular regions of CDO and neogenin may also associate ( unpublished data ) .
211						Together , the results in are consistent with the conclusion that neogenin and CDO form complexes in cis and that this interaction is dependent on the presence of specific repeats in the CDO ectodomain .
212						Despite its sequence similarity to , and ability to interact with , neogenin , CDO seems not to be an independent netrin receptor , in that it was unable to bind a netrin-1-Fc fusion protein under conditions where neogenin did .
213						Furthermore , BOC was also unable to bind netrin-1-Fc , and coexpression of CDO and and or BOC did not appear to alter netrin-1-Fc binding to neogenin ( unpublished data ) .
214						To gain insight into whether neogenin 's ability to bind to CDO is important for netrin-neogenin signaling , primary myoblasts derived from wild-type mice and mice homozygous for a targeted mutation of Cdo were analyzed for their response to recombinant chicken netrin-2 .
215						Cdo + / + and Cdo - / - myoblasts express similar levels of MyoD , but during differentiation Cdo - / - cells produce lower levels of myogenin and form myotubes very inefficiently .
216						Like myoblast cell lines , primary myoblasts expressed netrin-3 and neogenin , regardless of their Cdo genotype ( A ) .
217						Before treatment with netrin-2 , Cdo + / + and Cdo - / - myoblasts were similar in that each expressed somewhat higher levels of the more slowly migrating form of NFATc3 than the more quickly migrating , presumably activated , form ( B ) .
218						After 3 h of exposure to netrin-2 , the Cdo + / + cells showed a pronounced shift to the more quickly migrating form , consistent with activation of NFAT signaling ; in contrast , the Cdo - / - myoblasts showed no response and the ratio of the two forms of NFATc3 resembled that seen in untreated cells ( B ) .
219						Therefore , loss of CDO resulted in loss of responsiveness to netrin-2 despite the presence of normal levels of its receptor , suggesting that neogenin 's interaction with CDO is important for signaling by this pathway .

225						Discussion
226						Skeletal myogenesis is widely studied as a model system for the study of lineage specification and cell differentiation .
227						One reason for this is the tractability of myoblast cell lines , which are easily induced to differentiate into myotubes by removal of serum from the culture medium .
228						Consistent with serum deprivation promoting myogenic differentiation is the observation that many commonly studied growth factors are antagonistic to this process .
229						However , the positive regulation of myogenesis by signal transduction pathways strongly suggests that myoblast differentiation is promoted by extracellular signaling ligands working via cell surface receptors .
230						Although a few such factors have been identified , including IGF1 , prostaglandin F 2alpha , and interleukin-4 , the small number currently known is striking by comparison with the advanced state of knowledge on transcriptional regulation of differentiation .
231						Here , it is demonstrated for the first time that netrins and the netrin receptor , neogenin , promote myotube formation in vitro .
232						Furthermore , this is one of the only reports of a function for netrins outside the nervous system , broadening their potential roles in morphogenesis .
233						Netrins and neogenin promote myotube formation
234						"Several lines of evidence indicate that netrin-neogenin signaling promotes specific aspects of myoblast differentiation : myoblast cell lines and primary myoblasts express both netrin-3 and neogenin ; ( b ) overexpression of neogenin enhanced myotube formation by C2C12 cells , whereas RNAi mediated "" knockdown "" of neogenin inhibited it ; ( c ) exogenous chicken netrin-2 enhanced myotube formation in a neogenin dependent fashion ; neogenin increased the activity of myogenic bHLH factor- and NFAT dependent reporters ; and ( e ) netrin-2 treatment increased the levels of the activated form of NFATc3 , again in a neogenin dependent fashion ."
235						Taking these results together , we propose that netrin-3 and neogenin function in an autocrine loop to stimulate myotube formation .
236						Although exogenously supplied chicken netrin-2 and both endogenous and exogenously expressed neogenin clearly stimulated myotube formation , certain aspects of this putative autocrine loop remain to be established .
237						First , the level of neogenin produced by C2C12 cells did not change during differentiation , and , whereas netrin-3 did increase in DM , it was also produced by cells in GM .
238						Thus , something in addition to the amounts of these proteins may keep their signaling activities in check when the cells are in GM .
239						Because netrins are not freely soluble , but rather are associated with cell membranes and ECM , one possibility is that netrin-3 on the surface of one cell and neogenin on the surface of another may only encounter each other as a consequence of close cell-cell proximity .
240						Consistent with this possibility , netrin-3 produced by C2C12 cells was not detected in cell culture supernatants ( unpublished data ) .
241						Cell-cell contact is a promyogenic condition , and netrin-neogenin interactions may contribute to this phenomenon ( see next sub-section of Discussion ) .
242						Second , it should be noted that our evidence for netrin function in myoblasts relies on the use of exogenously provided chicken netrin-2 , and it has not yet been possible to generate direct evidence that endogenous netrin-3 works identically .
243						Unfortunately , none of several different netrin-3 RNAi sequences resulted in reduction of netrin-3 protein levels ( unpublished data ) , and neutralizing antibodies to netrin-3 are not available .
244	uaz:UA-CLine-1001000	c2c12 cell	e13,e14,c10	c10	netrin-3 fusion proteins bind to neogenin ; and endogenous netrin-3 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous neogenin	However , netrin-2 required neogenin for its effects on C2C12 cells ; netrin-3 fusion proteins bind to neogenin ; and endogenous netrin-3 co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous neogenin in C2C12 cell extracts .
245						Therefore , it seems likely that netrin-3 is a functional neogenin ligand in myoblasts , particularly as these cells did not express detectable netrin-1 .
246						Another interesting aspect of netrin-2 and neogenin activity in myoblasts was that these factors stimulated myotube formation without significantly altering the level of several muscle specific gene products , including MyoD , myogenin , and MHC .
247						In contrast , the levels of another muscle specific protein , TnT , were increased by treatment of C2C12 cells with netrin-2 , and induction of TnT was accelerated in C2C12 and neogenin cells .
248						It is possible that TnT represents a specific target of netrin and neogenin signaling .
249						Consistent with this possibility are the observations that neogenin enhanced myogenic bHLH factor- and NFAT dependent transcription in reporter assays , and netrin-2 treatment led to production of the activated form of NFATc3 .
250						Alternatively , it is possible that TnT expression is maximized within the cellular environment of the myotube , and that the elevated levels of this protein seen in netrin-2-treated cells occur secondarily to enhancement of myotube formation .
251						It may be that , while transcriptional regulation plays a role in netrin-neogenin-mediated myotube formation , the most important pathways involved in this process are similar to those used by these families of molecules to alter the cytoskeleton in migrating and turning growth cones .
252						Dynamic changes in cytoskeletal architecture are highly likely to be necessary for the elongation , alignment , adhesion and fusion steps of myotube formation ; although these processes occur simultaneously with induction of muscle specific gene expression , they may not be strictly dependent on transcriptional regulation .
253						The established ability of netrins and their receptors to signal locally at the tips of axonal growth cones makes them appealing candidates as regulators of the morphological changes that occur during formation of myotubes , independent of their ability to stimulate transcription .
254						Cell surface receptor complexes and regulation of myogenic differentiation
255						It has long been appreciated that cell-cell contact and and or high cell density positively regulates myogenesis .
256						This is apparent in disparate phenomena , such as the community effect in determination of the muscle lineage and the need for aggregation for differentiation of certain myogenic cell lines .
257						We have been studying a cell surface complex found at sites of cell-cell contact which is depicted as a model in and that includes : the related Ig and FNIII proteins CDO and BOC ; and ( b ) the promyogenic cell adhesion molecules , N- and M-cadherin , and the cadherin associated proteins beta- and alpha-catenin ( , ; and unpublished data for alpha-catenin ) .
258						This complex is well situated to coordinate multiple aspects of myogenesis .

269						A complex of cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules found at sites of myoblast cell-cell contact includes CDO and BOC , which may function as a receptor for a yet-to-be identified ligand .
270						CDO and BOC interact in cis with N- and M-cadherins , which bind beta- and alpha-catenin .
271						CDO and BOC also interact with neogenin , a receptor for netrin-3 .
272						Multiple signals appear to emanate from this complex , resulting in activation of myogenic bHLH and NFAT transcription factors and alteration of the actin cytoskeleton in preparation for fusion .
273						Note that although cis dimers of cadherins are shown , no stoichiometry of complex formation between CDO , BOC and neogenin , or between these proteins and cadherins , is implied by the figure .
274						Note also that the experiments that support this working model do not distinguish between the existence of a single complex containing each protein shown or multiple complexes in which some components may be mutually exclusive .
275						See text for further details .
276						The dynamics of neither the axon guidance receptor complexes nor the complexes in myoblasts that we have described are well understood .
277						Purification and analysis of native complexes will be required to address how many transmembrane components can be part of a single complex and whether some interactions are mutually exclusive .
278						However , a key aspect of the myoblast model is that the components of the complex or complexes display interdependence in some of their promyogenic activities .
279	uaz:UA-CLine-1001000	c2c12 cell	e27,c12	c12	CDO must be capable of binding to cadherins	Examples include : CDO must be capable of binding to cadherins to stimulate differentiation of C2C12 cells ; ( b ) BOC is dependent on CDO to promote differentiation of C2C12 cells ; and ( c ) netrin-3 ( assuming it acts similarly to netrin-2 ) requires not only its receptor , neogenin , but also CDO , to stimulate myotube formation .
280						Assembly of a multiprotein complex localized at sites of cell-cell contact and containing multiple signaling and adhesive components is an appealing notion , as such complexes could permit diverse signaling events that regulate both morphological and transcriptional responses to be coordinated during differentiation from a site in the cell that must undergo dramatic changes as myoblasts elongate , align , and ultimately fuse .
281						Complete identification of the components and dynamics of such complexes should provide important insights into myogenesis in particular and cell differentiation in general .
