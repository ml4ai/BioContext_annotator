29						in n1e-115 neuroblastoma cell , irs-58 induce neurite outgrowth where the neurite be complex with multiple branch point and elaborate growth cone .
30						a IRS 58 mutant delete for the src homology ( sh ) 3- and tryptophan , tryptophan ( ww ) - binding domain induce neurite extension , but not complexity .
31						in both swiss 3t3 cell and n1e-115 cell , irs-58 colocalize with f-actin .
32						in contrast , a IRS 58i267n mutant unable to bind cdc42h no longer colocalize with f-actin and fail to induce neurite outgrowth or significant cytoskeletal reorganization .

192						the colocalization of irs-58 with f-actin be see most clearly on the roof of the ring ( b , panel g and h ) , a point in the z-series where the intense f-actin ring be absent .
193						this confocal analysis suggest that irs-58 may be involve in microvillus formation .
194						next we investigate the effect of deletion of cooh-terminal region of irs-58 ( irs-58delta510-534 and irs-58delta143-534 ) and a cdc42h binding defective irs-58i267n .
195						overexpression of the irs-58delta510-534 protein that lack the area of heterogeneity between the human isoform give a more pronounced reorganization of the f-actin cytoskeleton , with most cell possess numerous well define f-actin cluster .
196						stress fiber be present in some cell transfect with this mutant ( irs-58delta510-534 ) .
197						the reorganization of the f-actin cytoskeleton cause by irs-58 require amino acid residue 143-534 since expression of irs-58delta143-534 do not cause loss of stress fiber or formation of actin cluster .
198						also , irs-58delta143-534 mutant do not induce the formation of peripheral plasma membrane structure ; however , cell appear to be more contract .
199						it be possible that the contracted morphology see in cell overexpress irs-58delta143-534 be cause by a thicken of stress fiber .
200						similar morphology be see when rhoa protein be microinject into cell .
201						overexpression of the mutant IRS 58i267n , which be unable to bind cdc42h , fail to induce filopodium formation or f-actin cluster in most swiss 3t3 cell ( datum not show ) .
202						however , in some cell express higher level of irs-58i267n f-actin become disorganized and small f-actin cluster be see .
203						strikingly , irs-58 i267n do not colocalize with these f-actin cluster or other f-actin structure present within the cell ( ; also see b ) .
204						to examine whether the cell process form in irs-58-expressing cell be retraction fiber or filopodium , we carry out a phase-contrast time-lapse analysis of microinjected cell .
205						IRS-58 induce dramatic change in cell morphology that include both filopodium formation and area of retraction ( datum not show ) .
206						unlike cdc42h overexpression , which lead to rac1 activation , we do not observe any membrane ruffle after the change in f-actin structure describe above .
207						overexpression of irs-58 in nie-115 cell
208						since irs-58 mrna be enrich in brain we next determine whether irs-58 overexpression have morphological effect on n1e-115 neuroblastoma , a model for neuronal cell .
209						we previous work have establish role of rho family gtpase in these neuroblastoma cell : cdc42h and rac1 be require for neurite outgrowth , whereas rhoa cause neurite collapse .
210						N1E-115 cell be transfect with cdna encode irs-58 , leave for 18-24 h in the presence of serum , and then monitor by phase-contrast time-lapse microscopy .
211						IRS-58 induce neurite outgrowth in these cell .
212						a show a example of a cell form a neurite where the length of the neurite approximately double over the time course of the experiment .
213						in the last panel of the time-lapse sequence three new neurite can be see to be form ( a ) .
214						IRS-58-induced neurite be morphologically hyperactive , as neurite induce by serum starvation show little morphological change over a 5-10-min time course ( datum not show ) .
215						IRS-58 induce filopodium formation in growth cone and along neurite .
216						b show a example of a neurite with many filopodium along its length .
217						the neurite form by irs-58 be thick and highly branch with robust filopodium evident around growth cone and along the neurite ( a , panel c ) .
218						in some cell , f-actin cluster be also evident in the cell body ( datum not show ) .
219						there be a loss of polarity in the neurite induce by irs-58 ( a , panel 6 and 7 ) .
220						( serum starvation of n1e-115 cell lead to neurite outgrowth where cell have a average of two neurite per cell and branch neurite be rarely present .
221						overexpression of either cdc42h or irs-58 in n1e-115 cell lead to a average of four neurite per cell and branch neurite be common .
222						we define loss and lack of polarity as a increase in the number of neurite per cell from two to four couple with the presence of branch neurite . )
223						cdc42h and rac1 activity be require for irs-58-driven neurite outgrowth , as dominant negative version of these gtpase be inhibitory .
224						IRS-58 cotransfection with rac1t17n result in smaller cell with large spike and filopodium ( a , panel f ) .
225						cell that be transfect with irs-58 and cdc42hst17n be flatten and have large fan shape lamellae ( a , panel g ) .
226						similar phenotype be observe when rac1t17n and cdc42hst17n be transfect in the absence of irs-58 ( datum not show ) .
227						we also examine the effect of overexpression of three irs-58 cooh-terminal deletion ( irs-58delta510-534 , irs-58delta390-534 , and irs-58delta143-534 ) on neurite outgrowth .
228						as in swiss 3t3 cell , irs-58delta510-534 have a more dramatic effect on cell morphology than wild-type in n1e-115 cell ( a , panel d ) .
229						interestingly , irs-58delta390-534 , which lack the sh3 domain and the ww binding domain , induce neurite extension ; however , neurite and growth cone complexity be lose ( a , panel e ) .
230						IRS-58Delta143-534 fail to induce morphological change , suggest that the amino acid 143-390 be essential for neurite extension ( datum not show ) .
231						a quantification of the effect of irs-58 transfection on neuroblastoma cell be show in .
232						finally , the effect of overexpression of the cdc42h binding defective mutation , irs-58i267n , on n1e-115 cell be compare with wild-type irs-58 ( b ) .
233						IRS-58 induce neurite outgrowth , as describe above , and localized throughout the neurite and with f-actin in filopodium .
234						in contrast , irs-58i267n do not induce neurite outgrowth , although in some case cell be see to elongate ( b , panel a , cell on right ) .
235						IRS-58I267N be distribute throughout the cytoplasm in small aggregate , but be never find at the cell periphery and do not colocalize with f-actin structure ( b ) .
236						use monoclonal antibody specific to irs-58 , we have find endogenous protein to colocalize with f-actin in filopodium in neuroblastoma cell .
237	uaz:UA-CLine-6607	n1e-115 cell	C6			a summary of the irs-58 and mutant phenotype obtain by cell transfection in n1e-115 cell be present in .
238						discussion
239			E13	C6	cdc42h interaction with irs-58	cdc42h interaction with irs-58
240						the cdc42h binding region of irs-58 be relate to the crib motif but also distinct from it .
241						close to the isoleucine , serine , any amino acid residue , and proline portion of the cdc42h interact site of irs-58 be a polyproline rich sequence that may represent a protein protein interaction site .
242						interestingly , similar polyproline sequence be find adjacent to the cdc42h binding site of ACK , pak , and WASP .
243						"point mutation of cdc42h in the "" effector site , "" c40 and a37 , have be report to exclude a role for crib motif protein , such as pak , in morphology pathway ."
244						however , several study have show that pak can induce morphological change in mammalian cell , as do both WASP and n-wasp .
245						in addition , n-wasp can induce filopodium formation in swiss 3t3 cell .
246						how can these datum be reconcile ?
247						one possibility be that the reduction in protein protein interaction cause by the c40 mutation of cdc42h in vitro be not sufficient to destroy interaction in vivo .
248						another possibility be that pak ( or n-wasp ) do not need to interact directly with cdc42h in morphological pathway but do so via a bridge protein and second messenger .
249						further , if protein complex need to be form to drive morphological change it be difficult to predict how the reduction in interaction between two component of the complex will affect the cellular process .
250						the effect of cdc42hsc40 and a37 mutation on cdc42h interaction with irs-58 be different from that of crib motif protein .
251			E14	C6	cdc42hsc40 still interact with irs-58	cdc42hsc40 still interact with irs-58 whereas cdc42hsa37 do not .
252						these datum support the idea that point mutation in amino acid position 40 and 37 allow cdc42h interaction with partner to be distinguish .
253						IRS-58 and cytoskeletal reorganization
254						to investigate whether irs-58 be involve in the cdc42h morphological pathway , it be overexpress in swiss 3t3 cell as a ha tag protein .
255						serum starve swiss 3t3 cell possess f-actin stress fiber and associate cytoplasmic fc .
256						IRS-58 overexpression cause a reorganization of the cytoskeleton with loss of stress fiber and formation of f-actin cluster .
257						IRS-58-induced filopodium formation be see most clearly at low level of expression where cluster be usually small , and thin stress fiber be sometimes present .
258						these change be reminiscent of the effect of cdc42h overexpression or bradykinin stimulation .
259						however , irs-58 do not induce the formation of membrane ruffle , which be see with cdc42h overexpression in a variety of cell type .
260						it be possible that irs-58-induced reorganization may obscure rac1 mediate change .
261						cdc42h , WASP , and n-chimaerin , but not rac1 or rhoa , can induce these f-actin cluster in mammalian cell ( ; ; datum not show ) .
262						the physiological function of f-actin cluster be unclear , but they may represent a intermediate stage for reorganization of f-actin microfilament .
263						confocal imaging of f-actin cluster reveal that they colocalize with irs-58 in structure that be protrude from the surface of the cell , suggest a role for irs-58 in microvillus formation .
264						the fact that bradykinin induce peripheral actin microspike as well as f-actin cluster formation support the idea that these latter structure have a physiological role .
265						IRS-58 and neurite outgrowth in n1e-115 cell
266						since irs-58 mrna be highly express in brain , we also investigate the effect of its overexpression in n1e-115 neuroblastoma cell .
267						endogenous irs-58 protein colocalize with f-actin in filopodium in neuroblastoma cell .
268						serum withdrawal or transient transfection of cdc42h in these cell lead to maximal neurite outgrowth after 18-24 h .
269						IRS-58 be also able to induce neurite outgrowth in similar experiment .
270						phase-contrast analysis of irs-58-overexpressing n1e-115 cell clearly show that it induce the formation of robust filopodium .
271						the morphology of n1e-115 cell overexpress irs-58 be different from that see on serum withdrawal or cdc42h overexpression .
272						IRS-58 neurite be much thicker and highly branch , and filopodium be evident all along the neurite surface .
273						some cell have neurite with multiple branch , each associate with large and spiky growth cone .
274						thus , irs-58-induced neurite be complex and lack polarity ( see above ) .
275						the cdc42h binding defective irs-58i267n fail to induce neurite outgrowth , and this finding parallel study in yeast cell where a cdc42p binding defective ste20 be unable to induce pseudohyphal growth .
276						IRS-58-induced neurite outgrowth be inhibit by transfection of dominant negative t17n cdna , suggest that cdc42h and rac1 activity be require for this phenotype .
277						interestingly , deletion of the sh3 domain and ww binding domain of irs-58 eliminate the neurite and growth cone complexity , but neurite extension in n1e-115 cell be still see .
278						therefore , it be possible that protein that bind either to the sh3 domain , such as atrophin-1 or ba1 , and and or the ww binding domain may be responsible for the morphological complexity observe .
279						function of the cdc42hs-irs-58 interaction
280						in both swiss 3t3 cell and n1e-115 cell irs-58i267n , the cdc42h binding defective mutant , do not induce significant cytoskeletal reorganization or neurite outgrowth , or colocalize with f-actin .
281						these result suggest that the function of the cdc4hs-irs-58 interaction be to localize a irs-58 protein complex to f-actin and thereby facilitate morphological change and neurite outgrowth .
282						Atrophin-1 and bai1 bind to the sh3 domain of irs-58 and may represent two of the protein present in the complex .
283						the insulin related growth factor , igf1 and igf2 , play important role in neuronal development and survival .
284						ongoing study with irs-58 , atrophin-1 , bai1 , and other irs-58 protein partner may help we to understand the mechanism by which cdc42h facilitate cytoskeletal reorganization and neuritogenesis downstream of the insulin receptor .
