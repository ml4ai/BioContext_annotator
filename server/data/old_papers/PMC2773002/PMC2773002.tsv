17						this study represent the first evidence of the distinct metabolic role of chokalpha and chokbeta isoform , suggest different physiological role and implication in human carcinogenesis .
18						these finding constitute a step forward in the design of a antitumoral strategy base on chok inhibition .
19						introduction

27						previous study suggest that chok act as a dimeric protein , and the proportion of the different homo- or hetero- dimer population have be propose to be tissue specific .
28						furthermore , the combination between choline kinase isoform result in a different level of chok activity in vitro under cell-free system condition .
29						thus , the alpha and alpha homodimer be the most active choline kinase form , the beta and beta homodimer the less active , and the alpha and beta heterodimer have a intermediate phenotype .

37						chokalpha be overexpress in some of the most common cancer , such as breast , lung , colorectal , prostate - and bladder ( unpublished observation ) .
38						furthermore , it have oncogenic activity when overexpress in human cell .
39						increase chokalpha mrna level have be recently describe as a independent prognostic marker in non small cell lung cancer patient .
40						also , human breast cancer cell line show upregulation of chokalpha but not chokbeta , when compare with normal mammary epithelial cell .

44						moreover , the activity of chokalpha be modulate by known effector of both ra and rhoa , .
45						pharmacological inhibition of chokalpha have be propose as a novel antitumoral strategy .
46						a strong support to this strategy be base on the use of mn58b , a well characterize chokalpha inhibitor , which display a potent antiproliferative effect in several tumoral cell line in vitro , and a strong reduction of tumor growth in nude mouse xenograft , - .

74						these result suggest that in cell-free system choline be a better substrate for chokalpha1 ( 2.85 fold ) than chokbeta , whereas ethanolamine be a better substrate for chokbeta ( 5.83 fold ) than chokalpha1 .
75						chok isoform be differentially regulate by ra and rho gtpase

150						thus , the differential enzymatic activity of chokalpha1 and chokbeta find in hek293t be not cell line specific .
151						these result indicate that chokalpha1 but not chokbeta , be able to induce increase intracellular level of pcho under in vivo condition .

178						discussion
179						the family of human choline and ethanolamine kinase comprise two gene , chka and chkb that codify for three enzyme , chokalpha1 ( 52 kda ) , chokalpha2 ( 50 kda ) and chokbeta1 ( 45 kda ) .
180						chokalpha1 and chokalpha2 be almost identical , except for a stretch of 18 extra amino acid in chokalpha1 , as they result from differential splicing from the same gene , chka .
181						while the implication of chokalpha1 in the regulation of cell growth and cancer have be extensively demonstrate , , , , , , , preliminary evidence suggest that chokbeta may not be involve in carcinogenesis since it be not overexpress in breast cancer cell line nor in the tramp mouse prostate cancer model .
182						a distinct human gene family have be describe that codify for etnk activity , suggest that etnk1 be the main enzyme involve in pe homeostasis .
183						the chok and etnk domain confer to chokalpha and chokbeta the ability to function as both chok and etnk activity under cell-free condition , - , but it be still unknown if these previously characterize enzyme show any selectivity to each branch of the kennedy pathway in the de novo synthesis of pc or pe .
184						it have be recently describe the different specificity towards Cho and Etn of the two isoform of Cho and etnk of tripanosoma brucei .
185						whereas tbcho and etn1 display only etnk activity , tbcho and etn2 display both chok and etnk activity in vitro .
186						these result be in keep with those describe for murine etnk1 that be etn specific and etnk2 that display a dual chok and etnk function , .

191						these finding of different role for alpha and beta isoform be in keep with the information from the recently generate Knock out ( ko ) mouse for chokalpha and chokbeta gene , .
192						thus , chokbeta ko mouse ( rmd mouse ) be viable , but develop a rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy , while normal pc lipid level be find in most tissue analyze except in hindlimb skeletal muscle .
193						therefore , chokalpha be sufficient to maintain normal pc level in most tissue .

195						these result suggest different role in vivo for both chokalpha and chokbeta isoform .
196	taxonomy:10090	mice	e37, s11	s11	the attenuated level in pe find in chokalpha+ /- heterozygous mouse suggest the involvement of chokalpha not only in the biosynthesis of pc but also in the pe pathway .	furthermore , the attenuated level in pe find in chokalpha+ /- heterozygous mouse suggest the involvement of chokalpha not only in the biosynthesis of pc but also in the pe pathway .
197			 e38	s11	this be also consistent with the fact that in chokbeta ko mouse , pe level be unaffected , indicate that pe homeostasis be fully maintain with the etnk1 and chokalpha protein intact .	this be also consistent with the fact that in chokbeta ko mouse , pe level be unaffected , indicate that pe homeostasis be fully maintain with the etnk1 and chokalpha protein intact .
198	taxonomy:10090	mouse	s12, e40,e41,e42,e43,e44	s12	choline kinase activity be the alpha and alpha homodimer follow by alpha and beta heterodimer , be the beta and beta homodimer the least active form .	the group of Ishidate have provide valuable information about the in vitro activity of chok from different mouse tissue , and they have postulate that the most active form for choline kinase activity be the alpha and alpha homodimer follow by alpha and beta heterodimer , be the beta and beta homodimer the least active form .
199					the in vivo result show here be partially in keep with this hypothesis .	the in vivo result show here be partially in keep with this hypothesis .
200					the in vivo activity of chokbeta be focus in pe biosynthesis and display higher km for choline than chokalpha , this could be the reason why beta and beta dimer show low chok activity .	the in vivo activity of chokbeta be focus in pe biosynthesis and display higher km for choline than chokalpha , this could be the reason why beta and beta dimer show low chok activity .
201			 e39	s12	when chokbeta be overexpress we observe a increase in the intracellular level of petn but not of pcho .	when chokbeta be overexpress we observe a increase in the intracellular level of petn but not of pcho .
202						however no difference be find between both isoform for the generation of PEtn , since both display similar etnk activity .
203						pcho have be propose to promote mitogenesis in mammalian cell .
204						in keep with this , magnetic resonance spectroscopy technique have reveal higher level of phosphomonoesther in tumoral sample when compare to they normal counterpart - .
205						moreover , overexpression of chokalpha1 be oncogenic , and enhance chokalpha activity be a frequent feature in tumoral sample compare to normal tissue , .
206						take together all these result strongly indicate that chokalpha1 activity and pcho level have a strong implication in cancer .
207			e45,e46	s12,s8	chokalpha1 result in a increase in etnk activity and petn level .	furthermore , overexpression of chokalpha1 result in a increase in etnk activity and petn level .
208						however the latter effect by itself be not sufficient to induce cell transformation , since overexpression of chokbeta do not induce enhance colony formation in soft-agar or tumor growth in nude mouse .
209						these result be consistent with the hypothesis that it be the production of pcho what be link to cell proliferation and transformation mediate by chok , and that the production of petn may not be sufficient or relevant in this process .
210						the above result suggest that the two chok isoform investigate , besides they similarity in they primary sequence , be implicate in different metabolic pathway .
211			e47,e48,e49	s12,s8	thus while chokalpha1 impinge into both pc and pe synthesis , chokbeta affect only pe synthesis .	thus while chokalpha1 impinge into both pc and pe synthesis , chokbeta affect only pe synthesis .
212						furthermore , the transformation capacity seem to be exclusive to the chokalpha isoform .
213	taxonomy:9606,uaz:UA-CLine-100104,uaz:UA-CLine-8182,uaz:UA-CLine-3884	human, hek293t, sk-Br-3, h1299 cell	s13,c8,c9,c10,e50,e51,e52,e53	s13,c8,c9,c10	chokalpha1 overexpression produce elevated level of both pcho and petn , while similar chokbeta overexpression result only in higher level of petn	however , since in the human hek293t , sk-br-3 and h1299 cell line , chokalpha1 overexpression produce elevated level of both pcho and petn , while similar chokbeta overexpression result only in higher level of petn but normal level of pcho , we can not rule out the possibility that cell transformation require both chok and etnk activity .
214						consistent with the idea that link oncogenic activity to the function of chokalpha , but not chokbeta , the antiproliferative and antitumoral activity of mn58b be only associate to the activity of chokalpha .
215						furthermore , as previously report , the in vivo treatment with mn58b result in a specific decrease of pcho level in the tumour but no significant effect on the level of petn .
216						previous result from we group have demonstrate that mn58b also inhibit choline transport .
217						however this effect have a little influence in the antiproliferative and antitumoral activity of the drug since hc-3 , a much more potent inhibitor of choline transporter , be far less potent as a antiproliferative agent than mn58b .
218						furthermore , mn58b have a differential effect on either normal or tumor cell , a strong demonstration of a differential activity due to chok inhibition - .
219						these result be also in keep with the observation that chokalpha but not chokbeta be a downstream target of oncogenic molecule such as ra and rhoa .
220						thus , while ra activate chokalpha through ral-gd and pi3k , and rhoa activate chokalpha through rock , none of these oncogenic gtpase affect chokbeta activity under similar condition .
221						again , these result indicate that although both chok enzyme be able to phosphorylate both choline and ethanolamine under cell-free system condition , they display different affinity for these substrate , and in whole-cell assay condition they be govern by distinct regulatory pathway .
222						finally , the involvement of chokbeta in breast and lung cancer have be study , chokalpha and beta mrna level be determine by q-pcr .
223						all tumour derive cell line assay significantly overexpress chokalpha mrna , while no change be find in the expression of chokbeta .
224						similar result have be recently report , use semi-quantitative pcr in breast cancer cell line .
225						in addition , it have be recently describe that elevated mrna level of chokalpha be a poor prognostic factor in lung cancer .
226						these result suggest that chokalpha but not chokbeta be play a crucial role in human carcinogenesis .
227						the result show here suggest that chokbeta and its produce metabolite be not implicate in human cell transformation .
228						therefore , all the effort aim at dilucidate the involvement of chok activity in the diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of cancer have to be focus in the chokalpha isoform .
229						in keep with this , recently the use of specific monoclonal anti-chokalpha antibody have be propose as a diagnostic tool in human cancer .
230						furthermore , the newly design antitumoral agent be expect to be more specific and hence less toxic than the actual drug use in conventional chemotherapy .
231						due to the high structural homology display by both choline kinase protein , the search for new anticancer agent base on they ability to interfere with chok activity , must exhibit stronger antiproliferative activity base on they specificity towards the chokalpha isoform .
232						the lack of specific inhibition of chokbeta by these newly design compound represent a new feature to take into account for the chemical improvement of chokalpha inhibitor with potential antitumoral activity .
233						furthermore , non specific drug affect chokbeta may result in a muscular disease produce by the lack of cell membrane lipid reparation in muscle tissue .
234						in addition , it have be recently demonstrate use a genetic approach that the specific inhibition of chokalpha by shrna display antiproliferative and antitumoral activity the high specificity of this technology provide definitive evidence of a antitumoral strategy base on chokalpha inhibition , support previous result with the pharmacological inhibitor .
235						-
236						thus , despite the high homology and similar activity display under cell-free condition , chokalpha1 and chokbeta isoform show a different substrate ability and behave very differently under in vivo condition , suggest that in human cell , chokbeta behave as a etnk and its overexpression be not able to induce higher intracellular level of pcho .
237						as a consequence , chokbeta have no effect on cell proliferation and do not contribute to oncogenic transformation .
238						finally , chokalpha but not chokbeta , should be use as the molecular target for the design of anticancer drug aim at interfere with choline kinase acitivity .
