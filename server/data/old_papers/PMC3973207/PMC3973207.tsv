1						block to thyroid cancer cell apoptosis can be overcome by inhibition of the mapk and pi3k and akt pathway
2						current treatment for recurrent and aggressive and anaplastic thyroid cancer be ineffective .
3						novel target therapy aim at the inhibition of the mutated oncoprotein brafv600e have show promise in vivo and in vitro but do not result in cellular apoptosis .
4						tnf related apoptosis induce ligand ( trail ) induce apoptosis in a tumor selective manner by activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway .
5						here , we show that a trail-r2 agonist antibody , lexatumumab , induce apoptosis effectively in some thyroid cancer cell line ( hth-7 , tpc-1 and bcpap ) , while more aggressive anaplastic cell line ( 8505c and sw1736 ) show resistance .
6						treatment of the most resistant cell line , 8505c , use lexatumumab in combination with the brafv600e inhibitor , plx4720 , and the pi3k inhibitor , ly294002 , ( triple-drug combination ) sensitize the cell by trigger both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway in vitro as well as 8505c orthotopic thyroid tumor in vivo .
7						a decrease in anti-apoptotic protein , pakt , bcl-xl , mcl-1 and c-flip , couple with a increase in the activator protein , bax and bim , result in a increase in the bax to bcl-xl ratio that appear to be critical for sensitization and subsequent apoptosis of these resistant cell .
8						we result suggest that target the death receptor pathway in thyroid cancer can be a promising strategy for induce apoptosis in thyroid cancer cell , although combination with other kinase inhibitor may be need in some of the more aggressive tumor initially resistant to apoptosis .
9						the incidence of well differentiate thyroid cancer in United States have increase dramatically in the past decade .
10						patient with the most common type of thyroid cancer , papillary thyroid cancer ( ptc ) , have a low risk of recurrence and high survival .
11						however , a subset of patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer ( atc ) present with large invasive tumor and and or metastase , do not respond to any chemotherapeutic regimen and often die within month .
12						New datum be emerge on the genetic or epigenetic change , which seem to contribute to such dramatic worsening of the prognosis in atc compare with most other thyroid cancer .
13						correlative study have point to increase incidence of mortality in patient who have activate brafv600e mutation , , in the mitogen activate protein kinase ( mapk ) / extracellular signal regulate kinase ( erk ) signaling pathway . , therapeutics block this signaling pathway be currently in clinical trial .
15						although brafv600e inhibitor work well in vitro in a anti-proliferative and anti-invasive capacity and effectively reduce tumor volume in vivo in animal model , they be not capable of induce apoptosis in thyroid cancer cell . , , Little be know regard the mechanism underlie resistance to apoptosis in these thyroid cancer cell .
17						here , we look at use novel apoptotic agent to increase thyroid tumor apoptosis by activate the death receptor pathway and show that in some case combination with anti-braf therapy be necessary to fully activate apoptosis .
18						tnf related apoptosis induce ligand ( trail ) ligand be a promising agent that induce apoptosis in a tumor specific manner by interact with specific death domain receptor , trail-r1 ( dr4 ) and trail-r2 ( dr5 ) .
19						activation of death domain receptor induce formation of the intracellular cytoplasmic Death Inducing signaling complex ( disc ) , which directly activate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway while also crosstalk with the intrinsic pathway through bid . , Lexatumumab ( hgs-etr2 ) be a fully humanize agonistic monoclonal antibody that specifically activate the trail-r2 and have never be test in thyroid cancer in any capacity .
21						Lexatumumab be currently in phase i and ii trial in advanced malignancy .
22						this antibody approach have several advantage over the trail ligand itself include improve pharmacokinetic and lack of decoy receptor binding , , , although some tumor exhibit resistance to apoptosis .
23						resistance mechanism include activation of c-flice-like inhibitory protein ( c-flip ) , , reduce expression of trail-r2 and trail-r1 receptor on tumor cell surface , overexpression of anti-apoptotic protein ( bcl-2 , bcl-xl and inhibitor of apoptosis ( iap ) family member ) and reduce expression of pro-apoptotic protein ( bax ) .
24						low bax and bcl-xl ratio have also be show to have a critical role in trail resistance . , , Lexatumumab have be combine with various drug to overcome resistance to apoptosis in a variety of tumor in vitro and in vivo .
26						these have include small molecule inhibitor ( lapatanib , cycloheximide ) , chemotherapeutic agent ( cisplatin , dacarbazine ) , antiangiogenic factor ( 3tsr ) and also pi3k and mapk inhibitor . , , , however , no study of apoptosis with lexatumumab have be perform in thyroid cancer .
28						result
29						some thyroid cancer cell line show exquisite sensitivity to lexatumumab induce apoptosis
30						treatment with lexatumumab ( 1000ng and ml ) for 24h result in significant apoptosis in three of the five thyroid cancer cell line .
31						apoptosis be measure by annexinv and pe staining for the percent of annexinv positive cell .

36						all cell line have functionally active trail-r2 receptor , with the highest level present in these sensitive cell line .
37						at 8h there be a decrease in the trail-r2 surface receptor after lexatumumab treatment , perhaps due to the high rate of cell death .
38						normal thyroid cell , htorus , do not undergo apoptosis with lexatumumab treatment .
39						lexatumumab inhibit bcpap tumor growth in a orthotropic mouse model
40						to evaluate whether the dramatic effect of lexatumumab observe in vitro would also result in tumor volume reduction in vivo , we examine the efficacy of lexatumumab in mouse bear orthotopically implant bcpap tumor .
41						the bcpap cell line be choose for in vivo testing because previous experiment in we laboratory have show that the other sensitive cell line ( tpc-1 , hth-7 ) do not grow well in mouse ( unpublished datum ) .

47						of note , there be no lung metastase in this bcpap orthotopic model .
48						some thyroid cancer cell line be completely resistant to lexatumumab induce apoptosis , whereas other show intermediate sensitivity
49						8505c cell be completely resistant to lexatumumab induce apoptosis ( 4.9+ / -0.9 % ) even at 1000ng and ml , and there be no caspase cascade activation and no apoptotic cell on tunel staining .
50						one other atc cell line , sw1736 ( brafv600e ) show reduce sensitivity to lexatumumab induce apoptosis ( 23.7 % cell death , p < 0.05 ) with some intermediate activation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway caspase .

52						baseline expression of pro- and anti- apoptotic protein be different among sensitive and resistant thyroid cancer cell line and be alter with lexatumumab treatment
53						the baseline expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic protein be analyze in detail .
54						generally in the cell line that respond with high or intermediate rate of apoptosis to the lexatumumab ( hth7 , tpc-1 , bcpap and sw1736 ) , the baseline expression of the pro-apoptotic protein , bax , be high result in a high bax to bcl-xl ratio .
55						the resistant 8505c cell , however , express low bax and high bcl-xl protein level , result in a low bax and bcl-xl ratio .

66						furthermore , give previous study emphasize the crosstalk between the mapk and pi3k cell survival pathway in promote resistance to apoptosis , , , we choose to study whether dual targeting of these pathway could overcome the severe resistance that 8505c cell have to lexatumumab induce apoptosis .
67						therefore , three drug be use singly or in combination to test we hypothesis : the mapk and brafv600e inhibitor , plx4720 ( 10mum ) , pi3k and pakt inhibitor , ly294002 ( 50mum ) , and lexatumumab .

69						dual inhibition with the mapk and pi3k inhibitor ( plx4720 and ly294002 ) without the apoptotic agent also do not boost apoptosis ( 5.9+ / -4.2 % ) .
70						however , combine lexatumumab with the inhibitor of either of the two pathway do result in increase apoptosis .
71						dual combination of lexatumumab and ly294002 increase apoptosis to 33.1+ / -13.2 % , p < 0.01 , whereas the dual combination with plx4720 cause a moderate increase in apoptosis to 20.9+ / -3.6 % , p < 0.01 .

83						subsequent treatment of these cell with lexatumumab ( 1000ng and ml ) result in 52.3 % apoptosis as measure by annexinv-pe staining as well as caspase 3 and parp cleavage compare with lexatumumab control ( 3.4 % apoptosis ) or scramble siRNA ( 8.4 % ) .
84						dual inhibition of pakt and mapk pathway increase the lexatumumab induce apoptosis in 8505c orthotopic thyroid model
85						on the basis of we in vitro result , we predict that the three drug combination would result in tumor apoptosis in a 8505c thyroid orthotopic model of aggressive thyroid cancer with wide spread lung metastase .
86						treatment be initiate 2 week post-orthotopic implantation of 8505c-gfp cell and continue for 2 week with either lexatumumab ( 5mg and kg body weight , iv twice a week ) , plx4720 ( 417mg and kg chow diet ) , ly294002 ( 50mg and kg body weight , IP twice a week ) or a combination of all three drug .
87						Controls receive normal chow and saline .
88						result show that 4 week post-tumor implantation , treatment with lexatumumab alone ( 76.8+ / -15.2 mm3 ) and ly294002 alone ( 72.5+ / -12.0 mm3 ) do not result in a statistically significant decrease in tumor volume or metastasis as compare with control ( 91.2+ / -20.6 mm3 ; ) .
89						we confirm that plx4720 alone reduce primary tumor volume by 95 % and completely treat the lung metastase compare with control .

92						all the tumor in the control group and the treated group stain positive for ttf-1 .
93						it seem that , while the reduction in the primary tumor volume be statistically no different between plx4720 alone and the three drug combination , give the dramatic tumor reduction in both scenario , apoptosis be clearly only trigger with the three drug combination .
94						human ptc expression profiling of apoptotic gene show a pattern of potential sensitivity to lexatumumab

106						agent trigger apoptosis have not be well study in thyroid cancer .
107						we report here for the first time the efficacy of the pro-apoptotic trail-receptor 2 agonist , lexatumumab , in induce apoptosis in a variety of representative thyroid cancer cell with well define mutation that include brafv600e ( bcpap , 8505c , sw1736 ) , nrasq61r ( hth-7 ) and ret and ptc ( tpc-1 ) .
108						we observe a range of apoptotic response to lexatumumab , with some be exquisitely sensitive ( tpc-1 , hth-7 and bcpap ) , whereas other be moderately or completely resistant ( sw1736 and 8505c ) .
109						interestingly , the mutational status alone do not show a direct correlation to lexatumumab sensitivity .
110						when expose to lexatumumab , the sensitive cell line be able to efficiently and rapidly activate both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway .
111						as there be a strong apoptotic response range from 83 to 99 % in the three sensitive cell line , we test the in vivo efficacy of this novel antibody in a orthotopic animal model of thyroid cancer use one of the sensitive cell line , bcpap .
112						we result show that lexatumumab treatment alone induce apoptosis in vivo , which result in effective tumor shrinkage of 67 % , indicate the potential utility of this agent in some patient with papillary or atc .
113						furthermore , expression profiling of five gene know to be important in regulate the apoptotic response to lexatumumab show that all 10 ptc sample directly from patient have profile that be similar to the BCPAP ptc cell line , which we have show here to be exquisitely sensitive to trail induce apoptosis .
114						not surprisingly , the most aggressive atc cell line we study , 8505c , show remarkable resistance to apoptosis with < 5 % of cell undergo apoptosis even when expose to high dose of lexatumumab .
115						these datum be consistent with we previous study show that this cell line be generally resistant to apoptosis when treat with other agent . , , we be able to induce apoptosis in this resistant cell line by combine lexatumumab with a pi3k and akt inhibitor ly294002 and a brafv600e inhibitor plx4720 .
117						we combinatorial strategy that be guide by known signaling pathway and genomic datum lead to rapid and sustained apoptosis in vitro and in vivo .
118						although plx4720 alone effectively reduce the tumor volume and the lung metastasis , it fail to induce apoptosis in the tumor cell in vivo .
119						development of resistance to plx4720 be a major limitation when it come to efficacy in treat patient as recurrent tumor growth occur from the few remain cell that have not undergo apoptosis .
120						this study point to the utility of the three-drug combination in induce apoptosis in the 8505c orthotopic tumor along with the rapid tumor shrinkage and reduction of lung metastasis .
121						this study among other can lead to better long-term outcome .
122						we datum show that two critical element have a role in the marked resistance to apoptosis in this cell line .
123	uaz:UA-CLine-2081	8505c	e12,c15	c15	 both a very high baseline expression of bcl-xl and a low expression of bax ( low bax and bcl-xl ratio ) and when expose to lexatumumab treatment mount a remarkable increase in pakt level .	the 8505c cell have both a very high baseline expression of bcl-xl and a low expression of bax ( low bax and bcl-xl ratio ) and when expose to lexatumumab treatment mount a remarkable increase in pakt level .
124						as pakt be a well-known anti-apoptotic protein , a sudden increase in pakt when expose to the apoptotic agent be in sharp contrast to the sensitive cell line , which show suppression of pakt level .
125						inhibition of pakt by ly294002 or knockdown of bax and bcl-xl protein ratio alone do somewhat increase the apoptotic response to 30 % however , only when the three-drug combination be use be these cell able to mount a apoptotic response up to 68 % .
126						the ' crosstalk ' between apoptotic and various kinase pathway be just start to be study in other malignancy .

131						we three-drug combination be likely effective due to effect on multiple front .
132			e16	c16	 the inhibition of both pakt and the mapk pathway control the regulatory increase in alternative pathway cause by the other 's negate pathway .	most importantly , the inhibition of both pakt and the mapk pathway control the regulatory increase in alternative pathway cause by the other 's negate pathway .

136	uaz:UA-CLine-100078	sw1736	c17			interestingly , we also find that one atc cell line have a intermediate sensitivity to lexatumumab - sw1736 , show a 24 % cell death response . ,
137			e17	c17	to a increase in pakt when expose to lexatumumab .	this cell line already have a high bax and bcl-xl ratio similar to all the sensitive cell line ; therefore , we hypothesize that the resistance to apoptosis be likely due to a increase in pakt when expose to lexatumumab .
138						dual-drug combination of a pakt inhibitor along with lexatumumab trigger increase cell death up to 84 % , indicate the importance of inhibition of the pakt pathway alone in this intermediately sensitive cell line .
139						we have show here that some thyroid cancer cell line be sensitive to apoptotic agent and these agent should be try clinically in appropriate patient .
140						appropriate patient may include those with no known mutation , high level of trail-r2 receptor and a high bax to bcl-xl ratio , as these patient have element to suggest that they tumor will be sensitive to apoptotic agent alone .
141						patient with either activate mutation in the pi3k or mapk pathway and and or a low baseline bax to bcl-xl ratio may need a combination of pro-apoptotic agent such as lexatumumab with kinase inhibitor to show efficacy .
142						further study in genetically engineer model of aggressive thyroid cancer in mouse , which harbor additional mutation such as p53 and braf , , will undoubtedly shed light on the true efficacy of a combinatorial strategy .
