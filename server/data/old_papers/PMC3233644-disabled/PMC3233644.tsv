1						a mek independent role for CRAF in mitosis and tumor progression
2			e1,e2	s2,s1		raf kinase regulate cell proliferation and survival and can be dysregulate in tumor , .
3						a role for raf in cell proliferation have be link to its ability to activate mek and erk .
4						here , we identify a mek independent role for raf in tumor growth .
5	taxonomy:10090,taxonomy:9606	murine, patients	e3,s1,s2	s2,s1		specifically , in mitotic cell , craf become phosphorylate on serine 338 and localize to the mitotic spindle of proliferate tumor cell in vitro and in murine tumor model or biopsy from cancer patient .
6			e4	s2,s1		treatment of tumor with allosteric , but not atp-competitive raf inhibitor prevent craf phosphorylation on serine 338 , localization to the mitotic spindle and cause cell cycle arrest at pro-metaphase .
7						furthermore , we identify phospho-s338 craf as a potential biomarker for tumor progression and a surrogate marker for allosteric raf blockade .
8			e5,e6	s2,s1		mechanistically , craf , but not braf associate with aurora-a and Polo like kinase 1 at the centrosome and spindle pole during g2 and Mitosis .
9			e7	s2,s1		indeed , allosteric or genetic inhibition of phospho-s338 craf impair plk1 activation and accumulation at kinetochore cause pro-metaphase arrest , while a phospho-mimetic s338d craf mutant potentiate plk1 activation , mitosis and tumor progression in mouse .
10						these finding reveal a previously undefined role for raf in tumor progression beyond the raf-mek-erk paradigm , open new avenue for target raf in oncology .
11						atp-competitive raf inhibitor have show clinical activity in cancer with activate raf mutation - .
12			e8,c1	c1		however , in ra drive tumor , these agent surprisingly promote craf serine 338 phosphorylation and tumor progression - .
13			e9	c1		we describe a allosteric inhibitor of raf ( compound 6 , refer to here as kg5 ) that do not compete for atp but inhibit phospho-s338 craf and tumor growth .
14						kg5 exert broad growth inhibitory activity against the nci-60 panel suggest that kg5 influence a general mechanism that be independent of ra or raf activation status .
15						tumor cell expose to kg5 appear round and arrest in mitosis , whereas cell treat with atp-competitive raf or mek inhibitor maintain adhesion and mitosis .
16			e10	c1		kg5 inhibit phospho-s338 craf cause mitotic arrest at pro-metaphase follow by cell death in multiple tumor cell line , mimic the effect of paclitaxel .
17						as for most kinase target drug , kg5 inhibit other target ( c-kit , flt-3 and pdgfr ) that might contribute to the anti-proliferative effect observe .
18						to address this , we evaluate kg1 , a structural analogue of kg5 that inhibit the same target except raf .
19			e11	t1,t2		kg1 do not inhibit cell proliferation , indicate the effect of kg5 be due to raf inhibition .
20			e12	t1,t2		phosphorylation of craf on serine 338 have be link to cancer progression - , - .
21	tissuelist:TS-0595,tissuelist:TS-0095	breast, brain	e13,t1,t2	t1,t2		to determine whether kg5 could suppress this activity in vivo , we analyze orthotopic breast and brain tumor tissue for phospho-s338 craf before or after systemic delivery of the drug .
22						a single kg5 treatment lead to a qualitative decrease in phospho-s338 craf and a accumulation of cell at pro-metaphase .
23						importantly , while ectopic expression of active mek fail to rescue the effect of kg5 on cell proliferation , cell express a phospho-mimetic s338d craf mutant show resistance to kg5 suggest CRAF s338 play a mek independent role in cell proliferation that can be reverse by a allosteric inhibitor .
24	taxonomy:10090,uaz:UA-CLine-100060	mouse, embryonic fibroblasts	s3,c2			we next examine mouse embryonic fibroblast ( mef ) derive from CRAF knockout embryo ( craf-/- ) .
25						asynchronize craf-/- mef show a significant increase in the number of cell in g2 and m and pro-metaphase , compare to wildtype ( wt ) mef .
26						follow synchronization , craf-/- mef accumulate in pro-metaphase with a dramatic delay in mitotic progression .
27						depletion of CRAF in tumor cell , similarly lead to a accumulation of cell in g2 and m .
28			e14	s3,c2		importantly , expression of kinase dead ( k375m ) , phospho-mimetic s338d or wt craf rescue this mitotic defect , whereas a non phosphorylatable ( s338a ) craf mutant , fail to do so , even though this mutant maintain kinase activity and can dimerize with braf ( datum not show ) .
29						accordingly , xpa-1 human pancreatic cancer cell express WT CRAF complete mitosis in twenty minute whereas cell express craf s338a do so in 120 minute provide genetic evidence to support a kinase independent role for phospho-s338 craf in mitosis .
30	tissuelist:TS-0595,taxonomy:10090,taxonomy:9606	breast,mice,patients	e15,t3,s4,s5	t3,s4,s5		furthermore , phospho-s338 craf be strongly increase in mitosis where it co-precipitate with gamma-tubulin and localized in g2 and m to the centrosome and mitotic spindle pole of tumor cell in vitro , or breast cancer tissue from mouse or patient .
31						importantly , kg5 , but not atp-competitive raf inhibitor , prevent this localization .
32						moreover , in cell treat with the microtubule stabilize agent paclitaxel , craf remain localized to the mitotic spindle suggest that kg5 and paclitaxel arrest cell at pro-metaphase via distinct mechanism .
33			e16	s4,s5		previous study have reveal that craf and braf can form heterodimer and that braf can play a role in mitosis - .
34						interestingly , while braf and craf heterodimer could readily be detect in asynchronized cell we could not detect such heterodimer in mitotic cell .
35						in fact , phospho-s338 craf localize to the spindle pole in cell lack braf .
36						these result suggest that the role that CRAF play in mitosis be distinct from that of braf .
37			e17	s4,s5		Mitosis be regulate by various mitotic kinase such as Aurora kinase , plk1 , and cdk1 - .
38						plk1 become activate by aurora-a in g2 , localize to centrosome , spindle pole and accumulate at kinetochore at pro-metaphase - .
39						accordingly , tumor cell express oncogenic ra be particularly dependent on plk1 activity for mitotic progression and survival , , and inhibition or depletion of plk1 cause cell cycle delay and arrest at pro-metaphase , - .
40			e18	s4,s5		interestingly , both aurora-a and plk1 co-precipitated with craf but not braf and craf co-localize with aurora-a and plk1 at the centrosome in g2 and spindle pole in mitotic tumor cell .
41			e19	s4,s5		interestingly , craf , but not braf , co-precipitate with plk1 and this could be detect in cell express WT or kinase dead ( k375m ) craf .
42			e20	s4,s5		however , this complex be minimally detect in cell express the s338a raf mutant suggest that the interaction between CRAF and plk1 require serine 338 phosphorylation but not kinase activity .
43						thus , craf may serve as a scaffold bring aurora-a and plk1 into a functional mitotic complex .
44						to determine whether the kinetics of craf serine 338 phosphorylation during cell cycle progression correlate with plk1 activation , we analyze CRAF ( s338 ) and plk1 ( t210 ) phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle from g1-m .
45			e21,e22	s4,s5		interestingly , phospho-s338 craf level be increase in g1 , as expect , but show a second wave of phosphorylation at g2 and m beginning immediately prior to plk1 phosphorylation , consistent with the notion that craf phosphorylation on serine 338 precede plk1 activation .
46						to further explore a role for CRAF in plk1 activation , lysate from WT and craf-/- mef be subject to immunoblot for phospho-plk1 or evaluate for plk1 enzymatic activity .
47						indeed , craf-/- mef demonstrate minimal plk1 activity compare to wt mef .
48						furthermore , tumor cell arrest in pro-metaphase with kg5 show decrease plk1 activity compare to cell arrest with nocodazole or paclitaxel .
49						while treatment of cell with kg5 have no effect on plk1 localization to the spindle pole , it prevent the subsequent accumulation of active plk1 at the kinetochore and similar finding be observe in craf-/- mef .
50						these finding be substantiate since a active form of plk1 be able to rescue the g2 and m delay cause by craf depletion .
51			e23	s4,s5		together , these result indicate that craf potentiate plk1 or aurora-a activation lead to accumulation of active plk1 at the kinetochore .
52			e24	s4,s5		this process facilitate mitotic progression through pro-metaphase and can be block by inhibition of phospho-s338 craf via allosteric raf blockade .
53						to investigate the impact of the craf and plk1 signaling module in tumor progression , we evaluate the tumor growth capacity of human colon carcinoma and glioblastoma cell stably express the phospho-mimetic s338d craf mutant .
54						HCT-116 colon cell express the s338d craf mutant show accelerate mitosis and a significant increase in tumor growth relative to cell express WT CRAF and this be associate with increase phospho-plk1 but not phospho-mek expression in these tumor .
55						similarly , u-87 glioblastoma cell express s338d craf produce a significant increase in brain tumor growth relative to cell express WT CRAF .
56						furthermore , cell express a double mutant s338d kinase dead ( s338d and k375m ) also show increase plk1 activity and tumor growth in mouse but fail to activate mek .
57						these result demonstrate that phospho-s338 craf be a important mediator of tumor progression base on its capacity to promote mitosis in a manner that be independent of active mek .
58						while raf be a essential component of the canonical mapk signaling pathway various report reveal that raf exert kinase independent function , - .
59						we previously show that CRAF , independent of its kinase activity , could translocate to the mitochondrium and protect cell from apoptosis by inhibit the pro-apoptotic protein ask1 , .
60			e25,e26	s4,s5		here , we reveal a kinase independent function of CRAF in cell proliferation and demonstrate that phospho-s338 craf localize to centrosome and mitotic spindle pole in g2 and m , where it interact with aurora-a and plk1 , promote plk1 activation and thereby mitotic and tumor progression .
61			e27	s4,s5		whether CRAF interaction with aurora-a and plk1 be direct or indirect still need to be determine .
62			e28	s4,s5		however , these datum support the conclusion that craf may act as a adaptor protein to promote aurora-a or plk1 activation facilitate mitosis and tumor progression .
63						while we finding may be relevant to all cell undergo mitosis , target this pathway with allosteric raf inhibitor , like kg5 , might be particularly effective during angiogenesis and tumor growth , process characterize by highly proliferative cell .
64						finally , we study reveal that allosteric inhibitor design to block phospho-s338 craf and its function in mitosis represent a new therapeutic approach to inhibit the growth of a wide range of cancer .
