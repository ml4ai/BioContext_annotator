9	taxonomy:9606	patient	S1			the expression of p53 , ino and vegf in gastric precancerous and cancerous lesion and its relation with the clinical feature be determine with immunohistochemistry ( avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method ) on 55 randomly select gc patient and 60 symptom-free subject from the mass survey in the high-incidence area for gc in Henan , northern China .
10						result
11						the positive immunostainig rate for p53 , ino and vegf in gastric carcinoma be 51 % , 44 % and 51 % , respectively , and correlate well with tnm stage , but do not show significant difference among the group with different degree of gastric wall invasion depth by gc .
12						a positive immunostaining reaction for the ino protein be significantly correlate with lymph node metastasis ( p = 0.019 ; Spearman correlation coefficient ) .
13						p53 protein accumulation be higher in the poorly differentiate gastric carcinoma than in well differentiate one .
14						in gastric biopsy , no positive immunosatining be observe for p53 , ino and vegf in the histologically normal tissue and chronic superficial gastritis ( CSG ) .
15						however , p53 , ino and vegf positive immunostaining be observe in the tissue with different severity of lesion of chronic atrophic gastritis ( cag ) , intestinal metaplasium ( im ) and dysplasium ( dy ) , and the positive rate increase with the lesion progression from cag to im to DYS .
16						a high coincidental positive and negative immunostaining rate for p53 , ino and vegf be observe both in biopsy sample with cag , im and dy from the symptom-free subject and in gastric cancer tissue from the gc patient .
17						conclusion
18						the present result indicate that p53 protein accumulation and increase expression of ino and vegf might be responsible for gastric carcinogenesis and tumor aggressiveness of gastric cancer .
19						gastric adenocarcinoma ( gc ) be one of the most common malignant disease in China .
20						although the gc have be decline in its mortality rate , it remain the lead cause of cancer related death in this country ( Parkin et al. , 1992 ; World Health Organization , 1994 ; Nomura A , 1996 ) .
21						gastric carcinogenesis be consider as a multistage progressive process .
22						the early indicator for the subject predispose to gc be abnormal hyperproliferation of gastric epithelial cell , such as chronic atrophic gastritis ( cag ) , dy and intestinal metaplasium ( im ) , which have be consider as precancerous lesion of gc ( you et al. , 1993 ; Correa p , 1992 ) .
23						however , the information for the mechanism of gastric carcinogenesis be very limited .
24						the growth and metastasis of tumor depend on the development of a adequate blood supply via angiogenesis .
25						recent study indicate that the inducible nitric oxide synthase ( ino ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) and tumor suppressor p53 be fundamental play-maker of the angiogenic process ( Ambs et al. , 1994 ; Jekins et al. , 1995 ; Forrester et al. , 1996 ; Chiarugi et al. , 1998 ) .

33						however , because wild-type p53 do not repress hypoxium induce transcription of the vegf gene in stably transfect human colorectal carcinoma and human hepatoblastoma cell with a inducible p53-estrogen-receptor fusion protein expression system ( Ambs et al. , 1998 ) , it have be propose that there be a need for caution in interpret p53 function on the basis of cell transiently overexpress this protein .

35						it have be report that dysfunction of the p53 and mdm -2 pathway can be find in more than two-third of angiosarcoma ; thus , mutant p53 influence the development of angiosarcoma not only by affect growth and apoptosis control but also by up regulate vegf ( Chinrugi et al. , 1998 ) .
36						we hypothesize that alteration of p53 , ino and vegf expression may contribute to gastric carcinogenesis and influence the clinical behavior of gc via angiogenesis .
37						the correlation of expression of p53 , vegf and ino and clinical feature in gastric carcinogenesis , however , have not be well characterize .
38						to characterize the change of p53 , ino and vegf expression in human gastric carcinogenesis , the present study be undertake to determine the protein level of p53 , ino and vegf in normal tissue and the tissue with different severity of lesion of CSG , cag , dy , im and gc with and without lymph node metastasis from surgically resected human gc and gastric biopsy from symptom-free subject .

114						the correlation be significant .
115						discussion
116						a interesting observation in this study be that the immunoreactivity of p53 , ino and vegf occur in the early stage of gastric carcinogenesis .
117						the positive immunostaining cell be invariably associate with cell proliferate activity .
118						with the lesion progress from normal to CSG to cag to im to DYS , and to gc , the positive immunostaining rate for p53 , ino and vegf increase significantly , the increase tendency for p53 , ino and vegf have a good linear correlation with lesion progression .
119						the present result indicate that p53 protein accumulation and increase expression of ino and vegf may be important molecular event involve in the early stage of gastric carcinogenesis .
120						another interesting observation be that , a high coincidental positive immunostaining rate for p53 and ino ( 36 % ) and p53 and vegf ( 35 % ) be observe .
121						this result be consistent with the finding in human lung and colon carcinoma ( Ambs et al. , 1999 ) .
122						although p53 antibody use in this study could not differentiate wild-type p53 from mutant p53 , previous study have indicate that p53 protein detect by immunohistochemistry seem to representative most mutant p53 .
123						Accumulation of p53 be a indicator for a loss of p53 tumor suppressor function .
124						both mutation and protein protein interaction can cause a p53 accumulation ( Wang , et al. , 1994 ) .
125			E10	T5	p53 protein accumulation in this study may lead to the loss of cell proliferation control and inhibition for ino and vegf	consider that p53 protein accumulation be correlate with poorly differentiation and t2 , t3 and t4 tnm stage of gc , we conclude that p53 protein accumulation in this study may lead to the loss of cell proliferation control and inhibition for ino and vegf , possibly because of p53 gene mutation .
126	tissuelist:TS-0978	gastric	T5			thus , the high coincidental expression of ino and vegf and p53 protein accumulation may be important event to enhance gastric carcinogenesis and poorly clinical feature and may be useful biomarker to assess risk for the development of gc .
127						recent study on japanese gc patient have show that increase expression of vegf and p53 protein accumulation be associate with intra-tumoral angiogenesis ( Takeuchi , et al. , 2000 ; Saito , et al. , 1999 ) and poor prognosis ( Skatani , et al. , 2000 ; Ikeguchi , et al. , 2000 ; Maeda , et al. , 1998 ) .
128						rajnkova report that increase expression of ino may promote gastric cancer progression by provide a selective growth advantage to tumor cell with non function p53 .
129						( rajnkova , et al. , 2001 )
130						the third observation in this study be that increase expression of ino and vegf and p53 protein accumulation occur with a high frequency in gastric biopsy sample with im .
131						IM , which may be define as the replacement of gastric mucosa by gland which have the histological , histochemical , and physiological characteristic of the small intestine , have be strongly associate with stomach cancer .
132						the present result demonstrate that im be a unstable stage with active molecular change , and further analysis to compare these change with normal small intestine will provide more information for the significance of im in gastric carcinogenesis .
133						finally , the present study demonstrate that the positive immunostaining rate of ino be correlate well with gc lymph node metastasis , increase expression of vegf and p53 protein accumulation be relate with tnm stage and gc differentiation .
134						these finding indicate that p53 , ino and vegf may be useful biomarker for gc aggressiveness .
135						the molecular basis for the observed expression of ino and vegf and p53 protein accumulation and they role in the progression of gastric pre-cancerous lesion and angeogenesis require to be carefully investigate in the laboratory and follow-up study .
