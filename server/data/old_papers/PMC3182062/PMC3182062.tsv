233						these finding indicate that activation of the notch signaling pathway after activation of e2f in rb family mutant hcc cell serve as a negative feedback mechanism to slow the expansion of the tumor cell .
234	tissuelist:TS-0564	liver	T4			activation of notch signaling be critical for biliary differentiation of liver progenitor .
235						this observation raise the question of the status of notch signaling in the liver progenitor population from which TKO hcc may arise .

237						immunostaining for hes1 and nuclear notch1 confirm the activation of the notch pathway in early tko lesion .
238						"however , although the notch pathway be transcriptionally activate in tko hepatocyte compare with they control , loss of the three rb family protein do not further induce the expression of notch1 , hes1 , hey1 , or Nrarp in TKO progenitor ."
239						"these finding suggest that transcriptional control of notch pathway gene by rb family member be cell type dependent and evolve during tumor progression , be more apparent in cell with low notch pathway activity ."

241						"however , the colony form activity of tko liver progenitor cell in culture be significantly impaired when these cell be sort from mouse and infect with a notch1 icd retrovirus , similar to what we have observe with hcc cell ."
242						this observation suggest that hyperactivation of notch signaling also inhibit the proliferation of liver progenitor cell .
243						"to address the relevance of the finding that activation of notch signaling may serve as a mechanism to dampen the proliferation of hcc cell to hcc patient , we take advantage of a dataset in which gene expression profile be link to patient survival ."
244						"in this study , clustering analysis have lead to the identification of two major HCC molecular group , with group b patient show a better survival than group a patient ."
245						"we find that the TKO dataset preferentially cluster with human tumor of the b subgroup , similar to what have be previously observe for tumor express myc and e2f1 ."
246						"interestingly , the expression level of the human notch1 and hes1 gene be significantly higher in group b versus group a ( p < 0.05 ) ."
247						"however , removal of these notch pathway gene from the analysis do not change the clustering of tko tumor to group b ( unpublished datum ) , indicate that other gene or pathway may be involve in the enhanced survival of patient in group b ."
248						the analysis of recent genome-wide chip experiment indicate that rb may directly bind to the promoter of other gene in the notch pathway such as jag1 and psen2 in senescent fibroblast ( ; unpublished datum ) .
249						these observation and we datum in hcc cell lead we to test the role of a broader notch pathway signature in HCC .
250						we find that a curated list of 17 gene use as a signature of the notch pathway independently predict increase survival in hcc patient ( ; and fig .
251						s5 e ) .
252						"therefore , activation of notch signaling in HCC may act as a mechanism to limit the expansion of hcc cell in patient ."
253						discussion
254						"in this study , we describe the consequence of genetically inactivate the rb gene family in the liver of adult mouse ."
255						"we find that rb family tko mouse develop HCC , provide a novel tractable mouse model for this deadly human cancer ."
256						"use this genetically define model , we identify adult progenitor cell as initiate population in hcc development upon inactivation of the rb pathway and we uncover a potential tumor suppressor role for notch signaling in human hcc ."
257						"rb family member display extensive functional overlap in many cell type , include in liver cell ."
258						"in fact , we find that the presence of one wt allele of p107 or p130 be sufficient to prevent hcc development for at least 6-8 mo after cre activation , similar to we observation in the hematopoietic compartment , indicate that reintroduction of one rb family allele significantly impair tumor development ."
259						we can not exclude the possibility that these mouse will eventually develop hcc at later time point ; indeed two of the cell line that we have isolate thus far from TKO mouse have retain a wt p130 allele ( unpublished datum ) .
260						"although it be difficult to directly compare the genetic deletion of rb family gene in the mouse system to the protein inactivation by degradation or phosphorylation observe in human hcc , these result support the observation that most event target the rb pathway in HCC simultaneously inactivate the three rb family protein ( see introduction ) ."
261						"a important question in the liver cancer field be whether HCC initiate from hepatocyte and and or earlier progenitor in the adult liver , a question which be challenge to address in patient ."
262						"cre activation in ctko mouse result in the proliferation and rapid expansion of cell with characteristic of liver stem and progenitor cell , include they morphology , they localization close to the portal triad , and they expression of specific marker ."
263						"at the same time point , we observe only limited dna replication in mature hepatocyte and no evidence of clonal expansion ."
264						"these observation , together with the fact that a fraction enriched for nonparenchymal progenitor cell can recapitulate tumor development upon transplantation , strongly suggest that TKO HCC tumor initiate from the stem and progenitor compartment in the liver of mouse ."
265						"the stem and progenitor cell hypothesis be support by evidence that Cullin 3 , a regulator of cyclin e ( a inhibitor of the rb family ) , prevent liver cancer development from liver progenitor ."
266						"although epcam and ck19 have be propose to mark some liver progenitor , immunostaining and fac analysis ( unpublished datum ) for these marker do not identify epcam+ or ck19+ cell in TKO early lesion ."
267						"one interpretation of this observation be that tko lesion initiate from progenitor that be distinct from epcam+ or ck19+ progenitor , which would underscore the heterogeneity of liver stem and progenitor cell population ."
268						this idea be support by the observation that progenitor cell expand upon inactivation of the nf2 tumor suppressor display different characteristic than progenitor cell expand in TKO mouse .
269						"in addition , we find that some tko liver progenitor be positive for marker that be originally develop in a model of ddc induce liver progenitor expansion ."
270						"however , the paucity of c3+ , c7+ , or e10+ cell in TKO mouse compare with ddc treatment ( compare with fig ."
271						"s2 , l-n ) , as well as the lack of organize structure in TKO liver versus the formation of atypical bile duct in the DDC model further suggest that the population of progenitor cell involve in the expansion in the two model be not equivalent ."
272						"nevertheless , the observation that some cell in early tko lesion express sox9 indicate that there be some similarity between the two system ."
273						future experiment will continue to compare marker express by adult liver progenitor cell identify in different system to better define distinct subpopulation of these cell .
274						"in the TKO model , we find that the colony form potential be restricted to two distinct mutant stem and progenitor cell population in TKO mouse , c3/c7/e10+ cell and sca1+ cell ."
275						"the decreased expression of bmi1 and the increased expression of lineage marker , as well as the increased cell cycle and colony form activity observe in TKO c3/c7/e10+ cell suggest that these cell may represent a more mature population of progenitor when compare with sca1+ cell ."
276						"c3/c7/e10+ or sca1+ cell be not able to recapitulate tumor upon transplantation , suggest that either they do not represent the cell of origin or that transplantation protocol need to be improve to allow a small number of purify stem and progenitor cell to colonize recipient liver ."
277						we datum strongly suggest that tko liver tumor arise from subpopulation of stem and progenitor cell .
278						"after exit quiescence and a initial phase of expansion , these tko cell undergo some differentiation , and these fairly differentiate proliferate cell represent the bulk of the hcc tumor ."
279						"this model fit with increase evidence suggest that loss of rb function initiate cancer from specific population of stem and progenitor cell , provide a general model for tumor suppression by the rb pathway ."
280						"however , we can not formally exclude at this point that a intermediate cell population ( i.e. , very late progenitor or early hepatocyte ) could also be the cell of origin in TKO HCC ."
281						"the recent identification of Cre express mouse strain in liver progenitor population may provide novel means to perform lineage trace experiment and to formerly identify the cell of origin of the tko tumor , include its differentiation potential and the role of the rb pathway in its cell fate ."

289						"in contrast , in vivo dapt treatment fail to increase proliferation in tko progenitor cell , either because these cell have already reach a very high level of cell cycle activity or because dapt treatment be not sufficient to block notch signaling in progenitor cell ."
290						"in vitro , we find that activation of notch signaling in mouse and human hcc cell be sufficient to block they expansion , as be report in one human cell line before ."
291						we further show that hcc cell with enforced expression of NICD undergo cell cycle arrest in g2 and display increase apoptotic activity .
292						"the notch pathway interact with multiple molecular effector , and there be probably multiple mechanism involve in inhibit tumor cell progression ."
293						"in the future , thorough investigation of notch effector should bring more mechanistic insight into hcc development ."
294						we finding suggest a model in which notch signaling act as a tumor suppressor feedback mechanism in response to activation of e2f transcription factor in tko liver cell .
295						"although this negative feedback be clearly not sufficient to prevent cancer initiation , activation of notch may significantly slow the expansion of tumor cell in vivo , and we find that expression of a notch pathway signature of 17 gene strongly predict survival in hcc patient ."
