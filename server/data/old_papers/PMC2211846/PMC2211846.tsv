330			e64	c17	tyrosine phosphorylated lat 	"it should be mention that these two hypothesis be not mutually exclusive : in the absence of NTAL , more tyrosine phosphorylated lat in lipid raft could better serve as a substrate for signal molecule , and at the same time the signal molecule could be more active due to the absence on ntal bind protein tyrosine phosphatase ."
331						"we experiment with bmmc defective in both adaptor protein , ntal and lat , surprisingly reveal that ntal , besides its negative regulatory role , may potentially also have a positive role in fcepsilonrus signaling ."
332						"clearly , ntal in the absence of lat can not play the above describe inhibitory ( competitive ) role and it may take over , albeit with lower efficiency , some of the function of lat , just as it be observe in t cell ."
333						which of these two function would prevail could possibly depend on qualitative and and or quantitative difference in the composition of the signaling assembly induce by fcepsilonrus aggregation .
334						these difference could explain why a diminution of ntal expression by silencing rna oligonucleotide in human mast cell result in a opposite phenotype ( reduction of fcepsilonrus mediate secretory and calcium response ) compare with that observe in ntal-/- bmmc ( this study ) .
335						"in this context , it should be note that profile of tyrosine phosphorylated protein in human and mouse mast cell be very different ."

338						"lyn dependent pathway , which involve transmembrane adaptor lat , serve as both kinetic accelerator and negative regulator of signaling , whereas fyn dependent pathway be essential for degranulation ."
