1						Association of traf2 with the short form of cellular FLICE like inhibitory protein prevent tnfr1 mediated apoptosis
2						background
3						"we have previously show that c-flipl be a more potent inhibitor than c-flip of fa ligand induce apoptosis and that c-flipl physically bind to Daxx , a alternative fa signaling adaptor ."
4						here we examine whether c-flip effectively inhibit tnfr1 mediated apoptosis and trigger jnk activation through its interaction with traf2 .
5						result
6						"some cancer cell line , such as du145 , ag , and pc3 , have higher level of c-flip than other cell line , such as snu-719 and t24 ."
7						the expression of c-flip correlate with the susceptibility to tnfr1 mediated apoptosis .
8						"in contrast to du145 and pc3 , which be resistant to tnfr1 mediated apoptosis , t24 and snu719 be sensitive to tnf-alpha treatment ."
9						"to address the role of c-flip in tnfr1 mediated apoptosis , we examine the molecular interaction between c-flip and traf2 ."
10						"as expect , western blot analysis reveal that traf2 antibody immunoprecipitate a greater amount of c-flip than c-flipl ."
11						"also , we measure the involvement of c-flip in tnf-alpha-induced jnk activation and apoptosis by compare these in tnf-alpha-resistant and tnf-alpha-sensitive cell line ."

13						conclusion
14						we now report that the short form of c-flip be a more efficient inhibitor of tnf-receptor 1 mediated apoptosis signaling than the long form of the protein .
15						background
16						"tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 ( tnfr1 ) exhibit diverse activity induce apoptosis and activate transcription factor nf-kappab , which lead to the induction of a number of anti-apoptotic factor ."
17						"after the component of the death induce signaling complex of the related death receptor cd95 ( apo-1 / fa ) be identify , it be widely assume that tnfr1 also recruit both the fadd adaptor and caspase 8 upon binding of its ligand , tnf-alpha , result in the subsequent initiation of apoptosis ."
18						"however , all attempt to demonstrate a direct physical association of fadd and caspase 8 with tnfr1 have so far be unsuccessful , whereas the anti-apoptotic component of the signaling complex contain tnf-alpha receptor associated factor 2 ( traf2 ) , tnfr1 associate death domain protein ( tradd ) and c-iap1 be readily detectable ."
19						"in contrast to we understanding of the fa and trail receptor , the molecular mechanism underlie tnfr1 induce cell death remain poorly define , despite extensive study of the signaling pathway that operate through this receptor ."
20						"it be currently believe that the engagement of tnfr1 trigger the recruitment of the dd contain adaptor molecule , tradd , follow by the dd contain ser and thr kinase rip1 ."
21						"this signaling complex be require for traf2 and 5 and c-iap1 binding , which lead to triggering of the nf-kappab and jnk signaling pathway ."
22						"tnfr1 binding by its ligand trigger these pathway , and can induce apoptosis by alternately bind the dd contain adaptor fadd ( through tradd ) , which facilitate caspase 8 recruitment and activation ."
23						"the activation of the tnfr1 death receptor by tnf-alpha lead to the recruitment of tradd , which serve as a platform for the formation of various signaling complex involve in different biological process ."
24						"for instance , tradd can recruit FADD and promote caspase-8 activation and apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway ."
25						"however , tnf-alpha be not cytotoxic to most cell because tradd can also recruit traf2 and rip to form distinct complex lead to the activation of nf-kappab and jnk [ - ] ."
26						"because activation of nf-kappab serve as a primary mechanism to protect cell against apoptotic stimulus such as tnf-alpha [ - ] , tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis require nf-kappab inhibition ."
27						the involvement of jnk in tnf-alpha-mediated apoptosis be highly controversial [ - ] .
28						induction of nf-kappab have be show recently to inhibit tnf-alpha-mediated jnk activation .
29						"moreover , block nf-kappab result in the sustained activation of jnk , which may directly promote tnf-alpha-mediated apoptosis ."
30						"however , although sustained activation of jnk promote cell death , the molecular basis of how this contribute to tnf-alpha-mediated apoptosis remain to be address ."
31						"one of the well describe apoptosis inhibitor be c-flip , which be also know as flame-1 / i-flice/casper/cash / MRIT/CLARP/Usurpin ."
32						c-FLIPL and c-flip contain two ded domain that be structurally similar to the n-terminal part of procaspase-8 .
33						"the c terminus of c-flipl consist of two catalytically inactive caspase like domain ( p20 and p12 ) , whereas the short c terminus of c-flip show no homology to procaspases-8 or -10 ."
34						both isoform of c-flip be recruit to the disc by DED DED interaction [ - ] .
35						"however , it remain to be clarify in detail whether the difference in the mechanism of apoptosis inhibition also reflect different functional role of c-flip and c-flipl and by which downstream mechanism they be mediate ."
36						genetic evidence suggest that fadd and caspase 8 be important for tnfr1 mediated apoptosis .
37						"in addition , expression of the inhibitor of caspase 8 , c-flipl , inhibit the tnf-alpha-induced apoptotic pathway , which provide further evidence for the important role of caspase 8 in this cascade ."
38						"expression of c-flipl be induce by nf-kappab , which may explain why death receptor induce apoptosis be generally block in cell with active nf-kappab ."
39						here we examine whether c-flip effectively inhibit tnfr1 mediated apoptosis and trigger jnk activation through its interaction with traf2 .
40						"the effect of traf2 in tnfr1 mediated apoptosis be attenuate by dn-traf2 , and the level of p-jnk in c-flip sirna increase more in tnf-alpha sensitive cell line than in a tnf-alpha resistant cell line ."
41						"in this paper , we demonstrate that the regulation of c-flip be relate to the tnfr1 signaling pathway ."
42						result
43						inhibition of tnfr1 mediated apoptosis be dependent on the expression level of c-flip
44						"to examine the relationship between the expression level of c-flip and the apoptotic response , we use real-time pcr to examine the expression of c-flip in human cancer cell line ."
45						"we have show previously that c-flipl be a more potent inhibitor than c-flip of fa ligand induce apoptosis and that c-flipl physically bind to daxx through a interaction between its c-terminal domain and the fa binding domain of Daxx , a alternative fa signaling adaptor ."
46						"interestingly , some cancer cell line , such as du145 , ag , and pc3 , have higher level of c-flip than other cell line , such as snu-719 and t24 ."
47						"however , the expression of c-flip at the transcriptional level do not exactly reflect the protein level ."
48						"this discrepancy may result from the low mrna stability of c-flip , which have be describe recently ."

61						"to elucidate the biological significance of these phenomenon , we examine the susceptibility of these cell line to tnf-alpha ."
62						"interestingly , the expression of c-flip correlate with the susceptibility to tnfr1 mediated apoptosis ."
63						"in contrast to du145 and pc3 , which be resistant to tnfr1 mediated apoptosis , t24 and snu719 be sensitive to tnf-alpha treatment ."
64						the sensitivity of cell to tnf be associate with the expression level of c-flip
65						"base on we previous finding , we speculate that the overexpression of c-flip would confer resistance to tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis more effectively than overexpression of c-flipl ."
66						"we investigate the role of c-flip in this pathway by transfect into snu-719 cell , which express a lower level of c-flip than other cell line , because we do not have a knockout cell line of c-flip ."
67						"although the ectopic expression of c-flip and c-flipl do not significantly inhibit tnf-alpha-induced apoptosis , the inhibition of tnfr1 induce apoptosis by c-flip be more potent than that of c-flipl ."

132						discussion
133						"although a specific role for each c-flip and a distinct mechanism by which each inhibit apoptosis have be propose , the function of the c-flip splice variant remain largely unknown ."
134						we current datum provide insight into the mechanism underlie the tnf-alpha-induced apoptotic pathway .
135			"E14,E15"	"C6,C7"	higher affinity of traf2 for c-flip	this pathway be characterize by a higher affinity of traf2 for c-flip over c-flipl and involve suppression of jnk activation and resistance to tnf-alpha-induced cell death .
136						c-FLIPS be also readily detectable in various type of human cancer and confer resistance to cd95 mediated apoptosis in t cell during the immune response .
137						we result be summarize in the model show in fig .
138						.
139			E16	"C6,C7"	tnf induce jnk activation .	"it appear that c-flip and c-flipl have distinct role , and we speculate that c-flip act primarily to support tnf induce jnk activation ."
140						"we result be consistent with previous datum show different function of each type of c-flip , include a specific role for c-flip in cd40 signaling ."
141						a distinct action of each c-flip variant in fa induce cleavage of caspase 8 have also be propose .
142						"accord to these earlier study , c-flipl and c-flip produce different end product in the caspase 8 pathway ."
143						"we datum also show that apoptosis sensitivity correlate with c-flip expression in several cell type , include dendritic cell , keratinocyte , and vascular smooth muscle cell ( datum not show ) ."
144						Figure 5
145						a work model of the role of c-flip in tnfr1 mediated apoptosis .
146						"the binding of c-flip to traf2 delay the recruitment of c-flipl , and c-flip and c-flipl block tnfr1 mediated apoptosis ."
147						"however , the cellular c-flip level be elevated sufficiently to block apoptosis and promote cell survival ."
148			"E17,E18"	"C6,C7"	 traf2 bind both c-flip and c-flipl 	"although traf2 bind both c-flip and c-flipl in we experiment , other report have show that c-flipl interact exclusively with traf2 ."
149						this discrepancy may be reconcile by recent study show that alternative variant of c-flip promote different tnf-alpha-induced signaling pathway .
150						"c-FLIPL have a strong affinity for raf , whereas c-flip be tightly associate with traf2 ."
151						the gene knockout and sirna knockdown study of c-flip report to date show that reduction of both c-flip variant sensitize cell to death receptor induce apoptosis .
152						we use a selective sirna knockdown approach to assess the specific function of endogenous c-flip and compare this with the function of c-flipl .
153						we result reinforce the conclusion that endogenous c-flip inhibit death receptor mediated apoptosis .
154			"E19,E20"	"C6,C7"	 c-flip interact rapidly with fadd and enhance the activation of jnk through traf2	"we datum show that c-flip interact rapidly with fadd and enhance the activation of jnk through traf2 may explain why c-flip show high expression level , despite its overlap role with c-flipl ."
155						"in addition , the expression pattern of c-flip be couple to the expression of tnf ."
156						we current experiment have confirm we previous datum show that each type of c-flip have a distinct target in the inhibition of apoptosis .
157						we postulate that the different expression pattern of the c-flip variant be specific to cancer cell type .
