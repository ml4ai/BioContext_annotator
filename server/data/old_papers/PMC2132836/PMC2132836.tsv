1						CDO , A Robo related cell surface protein that mediate myogenic differentiation
2						CDO , a member of the ig and fibronectin type iii repeat subfamily of transmembrane protein that include the axon guidance receptor robo , be identify by virtue of its down regulation by the ra oncogene .
3						we report here that one prominent site of cdo mrna expression during murine embryogenesis be the early myogenic compartment ( newly form somite , dermomyotome and myotome ) .
4						CDO be express in proliferate and differentiate c2c12 myoblast and in myoblast line derive by treat 10t1 and 2 fibroblast with 5-azacytidine , but not in parental 10t1 and 2 cell .
5						overexpression of CDO in c2c12 cell accelerate differentiation , while expression of secrete soluble extracellular region of cdo inhibit this process .

8						reexpression of either cdo or myod rescue differentiation of c2c12 and ra cell without alter anchorage independent growth or morphological transformation .
9						CDO and myod be therefore involve in a positive feedback loop that be central to the inverse relationship between cell differentiation and transformation .
10						it be propose that CDO mediate , at least in part , the effect of cell-cell interaction between muscle precursor that be critical in myogenesis .
11						in vertebrate , the skeletal muscle of the trunk and limb arise from the somite .
12						somite develop from unsegmented paraxial mesoderm as sphere of columnar epithelial cell that mature into distinct cellular compartment in response to signal from surround tissue ( for review see ; ) .
13						the ventral half of the somite develop into the sclerotome , which have a mesenchymal morphology and ultimately give rise to vertebrae and rib .
14						the dorsal region retain a epithelial morphology and comprise the dermomyotome , which give rise to skeletal muscle and dermi .
15						the dermomyotomal cell adjacent to the neural tube form the myotome , a layer of differentiate muscle cell position between the dermomyotome and sclerotome .
16						the generation of myogenic cell in the somite be regulate by signal derive from neighbor axial tissue ( neural tube and notocord ) , include wnt family member and sonic hedgehog , or by less well define signal derive from surface ectoderm .
17						determination and differentiation of cell in the skeletal muscle lineage also require specific but poorly understand cell-cell interaction between muscle precursor , know as the community effect .
18						the cell surface molecule that mediate the community effect be largely unknown , although cadherin be likely to play a role .
19						the earliest known marker that be specific for the skeletal muscle lineage be the four myogenic basic helix-loop-helix ( bhlh ) 1 factor myod , myogenin , myf-5 , and mrf4 ( for review see ; Molkentin and Olson , 1996 ; Molkentin and Olson , 1996 ; ) .
20						these protein function in both determination and differentiation of cell in this lineage and share the remarkable property of be able to activate the myogenic program in a variety of non muscle cell type .
21						during differentiation , myogenic bhlh factor activate muscle specific gene and coordinate withdrawal from the cell cycle .
22						they be also target of growth factor signaling pathway that negatively regulate myogenic differentiation ( ; Molkentin and Olson , 1996 ; Molkentin and Olson , 1996 ; ) .
23						in cell culture system , myogenic bhlh factor autoactivate and cross-activate each other 's expression , which likely amplify and maintain the myogenic phenotype .
24						also present in the regulatory region of many muscle specific gene be sequence that bind myocyte enhancer binding factor-2 ( mef-2 ) family protein .
25						although mef-2 factor do not activate myogenesis alone , they interact physically and genetically with myogenic bhlh factor to do so .
26						protein other than myogenic bhlh factor therefore play a role in the positive feedback mechanism that regulate the myogenic lineage , which raise the possibility that molecule that participate in the effect of cell-cell interaction during myogenesis could also be component of this network of regulatory protein .
27						myogenesis serve as a useful model to understand the relationship between differentiation and oncogenesis .
28						a variety of oncogene and growth factor inhibit differentiation of culture myoblast via multiple mechanism , include transcriptional downregulation of gene encode myogenic bhlh factor and posttranslational inhibition of these factor ' myogenic activity .
29						importantly , although cell proliferation and differentiation be usually mutually exclusive , the transformation-_NN and growth factor mediate blockade of differentiation of myoblast be not simply a consequence of maintain the cell in a proliferative state , since this inhibition can occur in the absence of cell division .
30						we have recently describe a novel member of the ig superfamily , designate CDO ( for cam-related and down-regulate by oncogene ; ) .
31						CDO be a member of a recently identify subfamily characterize by a extracellular region that contain five ig like repeat follow by three fibronectin type iii ( fniius ) - like repeat , a transmembrane segment , and a long cytoplasmic tail .
32						the other member of this 5 + 3 subfamily be the Robo like receptor , which be all more closely related to each other than to CDO .
33						multiple line of evidence indicate that the robo protein , of which one have be identify in C. elegan , and two each in drosophila , rat , and human , be evolutionarily conserve axon guidance molecule , most likely serve as receptor for a cn midline repellent .
34						rat , mouse , and human form of CDO have be isolate , but no function for these protein have yet be describe .
35						cdo be express at very low level in adult rat tissue , but at high level in rat embryo fibroblast .
36						cdo be transcriptionally downregulate by a variety of oncogene , many of which be know to inhibit myogenic differentiation .
37						we report here that cdo be express at high level during murine embryogenesis in somite , dermomyotome , and myotome , as well as in myoblast cell line .
38						overexpression of CDO in myoblast accelerate differentiation , while expression of secrete soluble form of CDO block this process .
39						oncogenic ra inhibit myogenic differentiation in a fashion dependent on loss of cdo expression , while other aspect of the transformed phenotype such as anchorage independent growth , be independent of CDO .
40						thus , CDO be a cell surface protein that play a important role in myogenic differentiation .
41						we propose that CDO be involve in regulate cell-cell interaction between muscle precursor that be critical in myogenesis .
42						furthermore , these result establish that member of the 5 + 3 subfamily regulate diverse process that contribute to morphogenesis and differentiation .

84						result
85						cdo expression in early myogenic precursor
86						previous study determine that cdo mrna be express at extremely low level in adult tissue .
87						since many other member of the ig and fniius family , include Robo , be express and function during development , cdo mrna expression during murine embryogenesis be assess by whole-mount and thin section in situ hybridization .
88						cdo be express in a variety of tissue in a broad and complex pattern ( P.J. Mulieri , D.A. Sasson , and R.S. Krauss , unpublished result ) .
89						the most striking expression be see in the somite and neural tube .
90						as early as e8 .5 , both the somite and dorsal lip of the neural tube express high level of cdo mrna .
91						the somitic expression coincide with formation of the epithelialized somite since no expression be detect in unsegmented paraxial mesoderm .
92						all somite be positive for cdo expression as late as e11 .5 ( datum not show ) .
93						thin-section in situ hybridization demonstrate that cdo expression be restricted to the dorsal region of the epithelialized somite ( datum not show ) , and be maintain in both the dermomyotome and myotome as the somite mature .
94						the observation of robust expression of cdo in the early myogenic compartment suggest a function during determination or differentiation of cell in the myogenic lineage .
95						to investigate this possibility further , study on cdo expression and function be perform with the well characterize c2c12 myoblast cell line .
96						CDO level be regulate during c2c12 myoblast differentiation
97						c2c12 myoblast proliferate in serum rich GM , but when culture at a high cell density in mitogen deficient dm they withdraw from the cell cycle , express muscle specific gene , and fuse to form multinucleate myotube .
98						under the condition use in this study , these cell express detectable level of myogenin 24 h after the shift to dm , and produce mhc 24 h after that .
99						myotube begin to form 2 d after transfer to dm , and the majority of cell nucleus be present in large multinucleate myotube after 4 d in dm .
100						c2c12 cell culture in GM express cdo mrna and protein regardless of cell density .
101						the level of both the mrna and protein be transiently but reproducibly increase about twofold 48 h after the cell be transfer into dm .
102						interestingly , after 4 d in dm when the culture be fully differentiate , CDO protein , but not mrna , be dramatically downregulate .
103						we have previously demonstrate that , in rat 6 fibroblast , CDO be posttranscriptionally regulate by cell- substratum adhesion .
104						it be possible , therefore , that differentiation mediate alteration in the repertoire of extracellular matrix molecule and receptor express by c2c12 cell play a role in this phenomenon .
105						overexpression of CDO induce precocious differentiation of c2c12 cell
106						to investigate the function of CDO during myoblast differentiation , c2c12 cell be engineer to overexpress CDO .
107						c2c12 cell be infect with control or cdo express retrovirus and select for puromycin resistance ; drug resistant colony be pool and examine for expression of CDO and they ability to differentiate .
108						the cdo virus infected cell ( c2c12 and cdo cell ) display a two- to threefold increase in CDO protein above the endogenous level produce by control infectant ( c2c12 and puro cell ; fig .
109						a ) .
110						overproduction of CDO have no effect on the morphology of c2c12 cell , or on they ability to proliferate in GM ( datum not show ) .
111						when challenge to differentiate , c2c12 and puro cell closely resemble the parental line , exhibit only a few small mhc positive myotube after 2 d in dm .
112						in contrast , c2c12 and cdo cell form many large mhc positive myotube at the same time point .
113						the extent of myogenesis be quantitate by determine the percentage of nucleus present in myotube .
114						2 d after the shift to dm , 17 % of c2c12 and puro cell nucleus be find in myotube , whereas 59 % of c2c12 and cdo cell nucleus be in myotube ( average value determine from four experiment ) .
115						consistent with these result , expression of mhc and tnt be increase in c2c12 and cdo cell relative to c2c12 and puro cell as determine by western blot analysis of cell culture in dm for 2 d .
116						however , expression of myod and myogenin be not increase by overexpression of CDO .
117						after 4 d in dm , culture of both cell type look very similar with ~ 80 % of they nucleus present in myotube .
118						thus , overexpression of CDO result in precocious morphological and biochemical differentiation of c2c12 cell .
119						similar datum be obtain when CDO be overexpress in p2 cell , a myoblast line derive by treatment of 10t1 and 2 cell with 5-azacytidine , indicate that the effect of CDO be not restricted to c2c12 cell ( datum not show ) .
120						because c2c12 be a long established cell line , the effect of CDO overexpression be also investigate in a additional strain of c2c12 cell ( here designate c2c12 [ e ] ) .
121						the major difference between c2c12 ( e ) cell and the strain of c2c12 cell describe above be that : the former cell express detectable level of myogenin before the shift into dm ; and ( b ) all the event describe in fig .
122						occur over 2 d instead of 4 ( datum not show ) .
123						overexpression of CDO by two to threefold above endogenous level lead to a striking phenotype in the c2c12 ( e ) cell : these cell form myotube even when culture at subconfluence in GM , a condition under which the parental or control virus infected cell be unable to do so .
124						as might be predict , this phenotype be not stable .
125						continued passage of c2c12 ( e ) / cdo cell result in a population of cell that display accelerate differentiation in dm , but no longer form myotube in GM .
126						thus , overexpression of CDO in highly differentiation-proficient cell be able to override the inhibitory effect of serum on myotube formation transiently .

131	uaz:UA-CLine-1001000	C2C12	C6			we therefore examine the pattern of cdo expression in ra transform c2c12 cell , as well as the effect of force expression of CDO on such cell .
132						c2c12 ( e ) cell be infect with either control or v-h-ras-expressing retrovirus , and be select for g418 resistance follow by infection with control or cdo express retrovirus and selection for puromycin resistance .
133						three cell line be then use for further study : c2c12/neo/puro , a double infection control ; c2c12/ras/puro , a transformed cell line ; and c2c12 / ra and CDO , a cell line that express both oncogenic ra and exogenous CDO .
134						these cell be analyze for expression of muscle specific gene at the mrna and protein level , for the ability to differentiate , and for transformation related phenotype .
135			E11,E12	C6	 ra lead to downregulation of both myod and myogenin , although a detectable level of myod persist .	as expect , ra lead to downregulation of both myod and myogenin , although a detectable level of myod persist .

137						furthermore , c2c12/ras/puro cell do not express the muscle structural protein mhc and tnt , nor do they form myotube , even when culture in dm .
138						in contrast to the other muscle marker , myf-5 mrna , which be express at a much lower level than the other two myogenic bhlh factor , be not regulate by either ra or culture condition .
139	uaz:UA-CLine-1001000	C2C12	E14,E15,C7	C7	the forced reexpression of CDO in c2c12/ras/cdo cell lead to a corresponding reexpression of endogenous myod and myogenin and	the forced reexpression of CDO in c2c12 /ras/cdo cell lead to a corresponding reexpression of endogenous myod and myogenin and , when these cell be shift to dm , induction of mhc and tnt be restore .
140						furthermore , c2c12/ras/cdo cell form myotube in dm , although these myotube be smaller and less abundant than those find in parental c2c12 cell or any control virus infected derivative .
141						it should be emphasize that c2c12/ras/cdo cell produce a level of CDO protein that be comparable to the endogenous level see in control c2c12/neo/puro cell .
142						furthermore , c2c12/ras/cdo cell reexpress myod , myogenin , mhc , and tnt at level only slightly lower than those see in the control cell .
143						they also express abundant ra protein , equivalent to the level see in c2c12/ras/puro cell .
144						finally , it should be note that under these condition ( 4 d after transfer to dm ) there be no difference in the extent of differentiation between control c2c12 ( e ) cell and c2c12 ( e ) cell that overexpress CDO ( datum not show ) .
145						similar to myod , therefore , reexpression of CDO be capable of reestablish the differentiation program in ra transform myoblast .
146						CDO , like myod , fail to revert other aspect of the transformed phenotype
147						expression of oncogenic ra in c2c12 cell lead not only to a block in differentiation , but also to additional response characteristic of the transformed phenotype ; e.g. , anchorage independent growth and morphological alteration .
148						force expression of myod in ra transform c2c12 cell reactivate differentiation , but do not interfere with anchorage independent growth of the cell .
149						we therefore test the effect of exogenous cdo expression on additional property of ra transform c2c12 cell .
150						to assess anchorage independent growth , c2c12 / neo and puro , c2c12/ras/puro , and c2c12/ras/cdo cell be each culture in soft agar .
151						as expect , c2c12/neo/puro cell fail to form progressively grow colony , while 21 % of the c2c12/ras/puro cell form large colony ( > 0.3-mm diameter ) .
152						interestingly , the c2c12/ras/cdo cell behave very similarly to the c2c12/ras/puro cell , also form colony with a efficiency of 21 % .
153						culture rat 6 fibroblast in suspension lead to posttranscriptional downregulation of CDO .
154						to determine whether the ability of c2c12/ras/cdo cell to form colony in soft agar be due simply to loss of stable production of CDO protein , cell be culture either on plastic dish or in medium contain 1.3 % methylcellulose , which permit nearly quantitative recovery of suspend cell .
155						such culture be then analyze by western blotting with antibody to CDO .
156						as can be see in fig .
157						a , loss of cell substratum adhesion do not result in loss of CDO protein production in c2c12 / ra and cdo cell .
158						the ability of these cell to form colony in soft agar be therefore not due to a failure to produce CDO when culture in semisolid medium .
159						c2c12/ras/puro cell also display a typical transform morphology : the cell be spindly , highly refractile , and disorganize when compare with control c2c12 cell .
160						interestingly , c2c12/ras/cdo cell maintain a transformed morphology .
161						c2c12 and ra cell that express retrovirally encode myod ( see below for a description of these cell ) be slightly less round than c2c12/ras/puro cell , but remain highly refractile and disorganized .
162						similar to the result of , these cell form colony in soft agar with a frequency of 22 % .
163						force reexpression of CDO or myod in ra transform c2c12 cell therefore result in very similar phenotype .
164						both gene restore the ability of the cell to differentiate without significantly affect they highly altered morphology or anchorage independent growth ( and see below ) .
165						reexpression of myod in c2c12 and ra cell induce CDO
166						one possible interpretation of the striking similarity of the response of c2c12 and ra cell to exogenous CDO or myod be that CDO can act as a upstream inducer of myod and myogenin expression .
167						the known autoregulatory activity of myogenic bhlh factor suggest a additional nonmutually exclusive possibility : that CDO be a integral part of a positive feedback network that control myogenic differentiation , and be itself regulate by the myogenic program .
168						to address this question , we express myc tag myod in c2c12 and ra cell via retroviral infection , and test the cell for expression of cdo by western blot analysis .
169						as report previously and as show in fig .
170						a , expression of exogenous myod ( myod * in fig .
171						a ) induce endogenous myod , and when the cell be culture in dm , induce the muscle structural protein tnt .
172						interestingly , force expression of myod in c2c12 / ra cell lead to expression of endogenous CDO , suggest the possible existence of a positive feedback loop between CDO and myogenic bhlh factor .
173						we also attempt to express myogenin exogenously in c2c12 / ra cell , but be unable to select cell that produce more than trace level of this protein , possibly because they differentiate prematurely .
174						nevertheless , the cell that make a low level of myogenin also restore a small amount of cdo expression ( datum not show ) .
175						the murine embryo fibroblast cell line 10t1 and 2 can be convert to myod express myoblast by treatment with the dna demethylating agent 5-azacytidine .
176						10t1 and 2 cell express barely detectable level of CDO , but two independent 5-azacytidine-induced myoblast line ( p2 and f3 ) express abundant CDO .
177						take together , the datum present in fig .
178						suggest that cdo expression may be regulate in part by the myogenic program .
179						however , unlike the four known myogenic bhlh factor , ectopic expression of CDO in 10T1 and 2 cell be not sufficient to convert these cell to the myogenic phenotype , as measure by expression of muscle specific gene or myotube formation ( datum not show ) .
180						secrete soluble CDO inhibit c2c12 cell differentiation
181						most member of the ig and fniius family bind in homo- or heterophilic fashion to cell surface protein on adjacent cell .
182						although cdo do not appear to mediate cell-cell adhesion , recombinant soluble fusion protein that contain the entire CDO extracellular region couple to either alkaline phosphatase ( ap ) or the fc region of human igg ( cdo-ap and cdo-fc , respectively ; fig .
183						a ) bind to the surface of various cell type ( datum not show ) .
184						we reason that if CDO exert its positive effect on myogenic differentiation via interaction with another protein ( s ) on neighboring cell , soluble CDO fusion protein might compete with endogenous membrane bind CDO and block differentiation .
185						to test this hypothesis , c2c12 ( e ) cell be stably transfect with expression vector for cdo-ap , cdo-fc , and , as a control , secrete ap alone .
186						ap activity be easily detect in the conditioned medium ( cm ) of the cdo-ap and ap transfectant ( datum not show ) , and cdo-fc be detect immunologically in cm from the cdo-fc transfectant .
187						these cell be then assess for they ability to differentiate .
188						as show in fig .
189						b , cell that express ap differentiate robustly ( 49 % of nucleus present in mhc positive cell , which be mainly myotubes ) .
190						in contrast , cell that express either of the CDO fusion protein differentiate poorly under the same condition ( 12 % of nucleus in mhc positive cell , which be almost exclusively myocyte ; fig .
191						b and datum not show ) .
192						consistent with this result , western blot analysis demonstrate that expression of cdo-ap or cdo-fc delay accumulation of the differentiation marker myogenin , mhc , and TnT .
193						as be observe with cdo overexpression , however , inhibition by cdo-ap or cdo-fc be not accompany by alteration in the level of myod .
194						expression of cdo-ap or cdo-fc also do not significantly alter the level of endogenous CDO ( datum not show ) .
195						comparable result be obtain when cm from 293t cell that have be transiently transfect with cdo-fc be add to culture of naive c2c12 ( e ) cell , but not when cm from mock transfect cell be use ( datum not show ; for production of cdo-fc by 293t cell ) .
196						the inhibition of differentiation by soluble CDO fusion protein be transient in nature ; after several day under differentiation induce condition , the culture that express cdo-ap or cdo-fc express muscle structural protein , and have form mhc positive myotube to nearly the extent observe with the ap expressing cell .
197						expression of soluble secrete CDO fusion protein therefore significantly delay , but do not ablate , differentiation .
198						this result be consistent with the notion that soluble CDO exert its effect in these cell by competition with endogenous CDO .
199						to confirm that inhibition of cdo function interfere with differentiation , c2c12 ( e ) cell be infect with a retrovirus harbor a murine cdo cdna in the anti-sense orientation , or a control virus that lack a cdna insert .
200						puromycin resistant colony be select , shift to dm for 3 d , and the percentage of colony bear myotube be score .
201						approximately 68 % of the colony infect with the control retrovirus contain myotube , whereas only 33 % of the colony infect with the anti-sense cdo express virus form myotube .
202						take together , these datum indicate that endogenous CDO play a important , possibly critical , role in myoblast differentiation .
203						discussion
204						CDO mediate myogenic differentiation
205						we report here that CDO , a member of the 5 + 3 subfamily of ig and fniius repeat contain cell surface protein play a key role in myogenic differentiation .
206			E16	C8	ra inhibit differentiation of myoblast in a manner dependent on downregulation of CDO	this conclusion be base on the observation that overexpression of CDO enhance differentiation of myoblast cell line ; that expression of soluble secreted form of CDO or antisense cdo vector inhibit differentiation ; and that ra inhibit differentiation of myoblast in a manner dependent on downregulation of CDO .
207	uaz:UA-CLine-1001000	C2C12	C8			additionally , overexpression of CDO in early passage , highly differentiation-proficient c2c12 ( e ) myoblast be sufficient to promote myotube formation in GM .
208						CDO be the only protein other than a myogenic bhlh factor able to override a serum- or oncogene induce block to myogenesis report to date .
209						the enhancement or inhibition of differentiation induce by wild-type or soluble CDO , respectively , occur without detectable alteration in the level of myod .
210			E17,E18	C9	 CDO may function by increase the activity of myod at a posttranslational level .	these datum suggest that CDO may function by increase the activity of myod at a posttranslational level .
211	uaz:UA-CLine-1001000	C2C12	C9			in contrast , reexpression of CDO in c2c12 and ra cell lead to induction of myod at the mrna level .
212						it be worth note that c2c12 and ra cell retain low level of myod and myf-5 , which be presumably keep inactive by poorly understand posttranslational mechanism .
213			E19,E24	C9	one possible explanation for these result be that CDO override or reverse ra mediated inhibition of the remain low level of myod and myf-5 , lead to activation of the positive feedback loop that regulate expression of myogenic bhlh factor and mef-2 .	one possible explanation for these result be that CDO override or reverse ra mediated inhibition of the remain low level of myod and myf-5 , lead to activation of the positive feedback loop that regulate expression of myogenic bhlh factor and mef-2 .
214						after a critical threshold concentration of these protein be achieve , the ability to differentiate could be reimpose , even in the presence of activate ra .
215						this feedback mechanism be think to amplify and maintain differentiation signal ( ; Molkentin and Olson , 1996 ; Molkentin and Olson , 1996 ; ) .
216	uaz:UA-CLine-1001000	C2C12	E25,E26,E27,C10	C10	it be therefore interesting that expression of exogenous CDO in c2c12 and ra cell lead to induction of myod and myogenin , and , conversely , expression of exogenous myod in these cell lead to induction of CDO .	it be therefore interesting that expression of exogenous CDO in c2c12 and ra cell lead to induction of myod and myogenin , and , conversely , expression of exogenous myod in these cell lead to induction of CDO .
217						these result indicate that a positive feedback loop exist between CDO at the cell surface and myogenic bhlh factor in the nucleus , and that CDO may be a integral component of the myogenic regulatory network .
218						in this regard , expression of cdo in early myogenic precursor ( newly form somite , dermomyotome ) could conceivably play a role in the determination or stabilization of the myogenic lineage , collaborate with or amplify signal initiate by wnt family member and sonic hedgehog produce by axial tissue , or by less well define signal derive from surface ectoderm .
219						this proposal , though speculative , be consistent with a requirement of muscle precursor within early somite for cell-cell contact in they response to such tissue ; i.e. , the community effect .
220						furthermore , the temporal pattern of cdo expression in somite and dermomyotome closely resemble that of myf-5 , the myogenic bhlh factor express earliest during embryogenesis and for which a role in determination be strongly indicate .
221						nevertheless , cdo expression alone be not sufficient to convert 10t1 and 2 cell to a myogenic phenotype .
222						although establish myogenic identity in vivo undoubtedly require a complex combination of positive and negative signal provide by soluble and surface bind signal molecule , this negative result with 10t1 and 2 cell should be interpret with some caution since CDO be apparently unable to bind to itself , and rodent embryo fibroblast cell line display little binding activity for soluble CDO fusion protein ( j.-s .
223						Kang , P.J. Mulieri , F. Cole , and R.S. Krauss , unpublished datum ) .
224						thus , CDO express at the surface of a 10t1 and 2 cell may be unengaged , and consequently nonfunctional .
225						regardless of CDO 's potential role in determine the myogenic lineage , it clearly play a role in differentiation of committed myoblast .
226						because the signal for differentiation of these cell in culture be withdrawal of serum growth factor , the role of signal molecule as negative regulator have receive the most emphasis .
227						the positive and possibly requisite role of CDO in differentiation suggest that positive signal emanate from the cell surface as well .
228						cadherin and n-cam have both be implicate in myoblast differentiation and and or fusion , but whether these molecule serve as actual signal transducer or as adhesion molecule during myogenesis be not clear .
229						in principle , CDO could act as a heterophilic CAM , but a signaling role seem more likely since CDO exert its effect on c2c12 and c2c12 and ra cell without produce significant alteration in cell aggregation ( datum not show ) .
230						CDO and the Inverse relationship between transformation and differentiation
231						myogenic differentiation be inhibit by a variety of oncogene and growth factor via multiple mechanism .
232						oncogenic ra in particular can inhibit differentiation by transcriptional downregulation of myogenic bhlh factor , and by multiple mode of posttranslational inhibition of they activity .
233						it be important to note that ra and specific growth factor can inhibit differentiation without necessarily force the cell to remain proliferative in dm , suggest the existence of activity that be specific for this aspect of oncoprotein or growth factor action .
234						we and other have demonstrate that various response to ra can be dissociate from one another , indicate that distinct combination of pathway control individual aspect of the transformed phenotype .
235						it be striking that CDO and myod each reactivate differentiation of c2c12 and ra cell without alter the transformed morphology or anchorage independent growth of these cell .
236						the indistinguishable and highly specific effect of CDO and myod on c2c12 and ra cell strongly reinforce the notion of a close mechanistic connection between these protein .
237						myogenic bhlh factor , mef-2 , CDO , and other protein may comprise a complex network of factor that auto-_VBP and cross-regulate each other ' expression and activity during myogenesis .
238						furthermore , the ability of ra to block myogenic differentiation be specifically link to its ability to disrupt this network .
239						activate raf and a ra effector loop mutant specific for activation of raf ( ras12v ,35 s ; ) each downregulate CDO in fibroblast ( ; j.-s .
240						Kang and R.S. Krauss , unpublished datum ) , so it be likely that raf be a major effector of ra in this aspect of its action .
241						preliminary datum also indicate that CDO be not nonspecific in its ability to override a block to differentiation ; tgfbeta1 inhibit differentiation of c2c12 cell without downregulate cdo expression , and c2c12 and cdo cell be not resistant to the inhibitory effect of tgfbeta1 ( j.-s .

243						function of the 5 + 3 subfamily of ig and fniius repeat protein
244						the 5 + 3 subfamily of ig and fniius repeat protein include the Robo like receptor ( one in caenorhabditis elegan , and two each in drosophila , rat , and human ) that have be implicate as axon guidance receptor in nematode and fruit fly , and likely play a similar role in mammal .
245						this study be the first to implicate a member of the 5 + 3 subfamily , CDO , in the myogenic program , and establish that member of this subfamily have highly diverse function .
246						it be intriguing that the sole 5 + 3 protein in C. elegan ( sax-3 / Robo ) be prominently express in muscle , as assess by a reporter gene .
247						sax-3 may encode multiple function that have be distribute among several gene that arise by duplication and divergance during the course of evolution .
248						it will be interesting to determine if there be defect in myogenesis in sax 3 mutant .
249						it should also be note that although CDO participate in the myogenic regulatory program , cdo expression be not restricted to the myogenic lineage .
250						cdo be also express at high level in the develop nervous system and other tissue during embryogenesis .
251						similar to its role in myoblast , recent experiment indicate that ectopic cdo expression can induce differentiation of a neuroblastoma cell line ( F. Cole , J. Feinleib , and R.S. Krauss , unpublished datum ) .
252						we hypothesize that CDO may play a role in mediate cell-cell interaction that coordinate appropriate differentiation of specific lineage during embryogenesis .
