15						lung cancer be one of the lead cause of cancer death worldwide .
16						although the management and treatment of non small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) have improve , there be no evidence that therapeutic advance have result in a marked increase of survival rate .
17						the overall 5-year survival rate remain at less than 15 % .
18						it be not fully understand why patient with comparable stage of nsclc may have different clinical course and respond differently to similar treatment .
19						a more sophisticated understanding of the pathogenesis and biology of these tumour could provide useful information for predict clinical outcome , individualise treatment , and identify molecular target of the treatment .

29						however , galnac-t3 expression have not be previously examine in human lung cancer , or in human bronchial epithelial cell and alveolar pneumocyte , from which lung cancer develop .
30						in the present study , galnac-t3 expression be examine by immunohistochemistry in surgically resected nsclc .

115						GalNAC-T3 expression be not a prognostic factor in squamous cell carcinoma ( hazard ratio , 0.91 ; p = 0.8 ) .
116						discussion
117						in the present study , galnac-t3 expression be frequently decrease in nsclc , although it be express in normal bronchial epithelial cell , bronchial gland cell and alveolar pneumocyte .
118						furthermore , low galnac-t3 expression of nsclc be associate with a shorter survival period , and be a unfavourable prognostic factor .
119						the finding that galnac-t3 expression be retain more frequently in nonsquamous cell carcinoma ( most of which be adenocarcinoma ) than in squamous cell carcinoma may reflect tissue specific expression of galnac-t3 in organ that contain secretory epithelial gland .
120						moreover , in nonsquamous cell carcinoma , decrease expression of galnac-t3 be associate with unfavourable prognosis .
121						consistent with these result , we have recently find that galnac-t3 be express in normal epithelial cell and gland cell of the colon , and that decrease expression of galnac-t3 be a unfavourable prognostic factor in adenocarcinoma of the colon .
122						the mechanism underlie the relationship between decrease galnac-t3 expression and poor prognosis remain to be determine .
123						bronchial and alveolar epithelium , from which nsclc develop , normally express galnac-t3 .
124						decrease galnac-t3 expression may induce decrease level of glycosylation in certain type of glycoprotein , result in altered function of the glycoprotein .
125						therefore , the biological importance of galnac-t3 expression depend on the function of target substrate glycoprotein .
126						the importance of galnac-t3 expression for the development and progression of cancer as well as for maintain physiologic property of normal cell also remain to be determine , although certain cancer associate decrease or increase in glycosylation have be show to directly contribute to cellular transformation .
127						collectively , decrease expression of galnac-t3 may directly contribute to altered biological property of nsclc .
128						in fact , in this study , low expression of galnac-t3 in nsclc be associate with a higher li of ki-67 cell growth fraction , and result in shorter survival time .
129						in conclusion , these result indicate that galnac-t3 be a new marker of nsclc with specificity for histology and survival .
130						GalNAc-T3 expression may be useful to stratify patient with pstage I tumour into group at high and low risk of recurrence in nsclc , especially in nonsquamous cell carcinoma .
